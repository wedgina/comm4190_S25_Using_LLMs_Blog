    "section": "",
    "text": "The ending to a show is very important. We spent mad energy watching shows we love and seeing it end can be sad, but its ending can truly make or break it. It can be so disappointing genuinely enjoying the show but it having a terrible ending or just watching it be cancelled overall (I’m looking at you Netflix!). So I decided to prompt Chat GPT to create alternative endings to shows that already have endings to compare whether it could write a better ending than what was already written.\n\nfrom langchain_core.prompts.chat import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import (\n                                        RunnablePassthrough,\n                                        RunnableLambda,\n                                        RunnableParallel\n)\n\nfrom langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n\n\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n\n# Load API key\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nplot_generation_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\n    \"\"\"Given the following show, create an effective\n    ending for how it should end:\n    ---\n    Show: {Show}\n    ---\n    Ending: \"\"\"\n    )\n\nplot_alternative_ending_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\n    \"\"\"Given the following show, create an effective alternative\n    ending to how the last episode actually ended:\n    ---\n    Show: {Show}\n    ---\n    AlternativeEnding: \"\"\"\n    )\n\n\n# Create the chat model:\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4\")\n\n# Create the sub-chains:\n\nplot_generation_chain = ( plot_generation_prompt\n| model\n| StrOutputParser() )\n\nplot_alternative_ending_chain = ( plot_alternative_ending_prompt\n| model\n| StrOutputParser() )\n\n\n\n\nmanifest_alternative = plot_alternative_ending_chain.invoke({'Show': 'Manifest'})\n\n\ncobra_kai_alternative = plot_alternative_ending_chain.invoke({'Show': 'Cobra Kai'})\n\n\nNHIE = plot_alternative_ending_chain.invoke({'Show': 'Never Have I Ever'})\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(Markdown(manifest_alternative))\n\nInstead of following the original ending where the story leaves various character’s fates ambiguous after the reappearing of Montego Air Flight 828, this alternative ending reveals more.\nAs tensions mount under the increasing pressure of the prophetic ‘death date’, passengers of flight 828 decided to take the matter into their own hands. They rally together, gathering all the knowledge, expertise, and experiences they’ve collected since returning. Ben Stone leads the team, aided by his sister Michaela and brother-in-law Zeke, who beat his death date in the original series, convince him it can be beaten. They develop a theory that their shared explosive vision of the plane is the key to understanding their newfound abilities and the ultimate tool to beating the death date.\nA chemistry professor from the flight 828, takes his chance to analyze the visions, using it alongside scientific principles to detect a pattern. The passengers agree to let their brains be examined while they experience the visions, realizing that whenever the vision occurs, a specific part of their brain gets activated. Risking everything, they decide to artificially stimulate this brain region, hoping to understand its function better.\nMeanwhile, Saanvi and Adrian have been working on deciphering the origins of the DNA anomaly found in the passengers. Their research leads them to a groundbreaking discovery: the anomaly is not a mutation but a highly advanced form of gene therapy designed to activate latent psychic abilities in humans.\nThis shocking revelation motivates the group even further. They eventually discover a means to control their abilities actively and use them to see beyond their personal death date in time. It’s like they’ve hacked their visions to see what they need and would like.\nIn this moment of triumph, the story takes another surprising turn. The day everyone has been dreading arrives, their death date. However, they don’t find death but become aware of a new calling, a new vision leading them to a hidden, unknown location. The disappearance of flight 828 passengers repeats, only this time it’s not an accident. They all decided to embark on a new journey filled with countless possibilities leaving behind a world that pretty much gave up on them twice.\nThe show ends with a sense of hope for the passengers and their loved ones, while leaving behind a world puzzled by the true nature and purpose of Montego Air Flight 828.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany are not aware of this show, but to be honest, its original ending was one of my favorite endings I’ve ever endured. I give this ending a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. I feel like there are parts of this ending that are inconsistent with previous information from the series. In the entire show I never even remember Saanvi or Adrian even interacting with each other once, they don’t really have any story lines that really have to do with each other side from the fact they were on the same flight.\nI also find the passengers allowing their brains to be examined by the chemistry professor to be unbelievable because in previous seasons there have been issues with the government exploiting some of the passengers and doing secret unethical experiments on them like they weren’t even people, so I find it hard to believe they will just hand their brain over to be examined like that.\nAside from these inaccuracies I also feel that this explanation is not well detailed. I’m confused and trying to follow what happens when it talks about the approaching death date. How does the disappearance of the passengers happen again? Do they take another flight 828?? How did they do this on purpose this time. I get leaving us with questions, but I feel like leaving us with the question about what happens to them when they disappear could be a nice ending, but not explaining how they got to the point where they disappear is not good writing. Do they vanish into thin air, do they get back on to flight 828??? Like what is it??\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(Markdown(cobra_kai_alternative))\n\nIn the final tournament, Johnny Lawrence’s Cobra Kai and Daniel LaRusso’s Miyagi-Do face off once again. The pupils of both dojos fight spiritedly, ensuring both Dojos are evenly garnishing points. The deciding match comes down to Miguel Diaz, who is fighting for Cobra Kai, and Robby Keene, fighting for Miyagi-Do.\nJust as it looks like Miguel has the upper hand, time stops as he has vivid flashbacks of when he was severely injured during a previous fight which left him comatose. The match resumes. It’s intense, mirroring the inherent tension between Johnny and Daniel from their youth, but Miguel loses focus, giving Robby the opportunity to win. But, in an unexpected twist, Robby opts not to exploit Miguel’s vulnerability, demonstrating the teaching of his Sensei, Daniel LaRusso: “It is about being better than you were yesterday.”\nRobby helps Miguel back to his feet, and the match resumes. After a long hard-fought battle from both sides, Miguel manages to win, but with the understanding that the real victory is not about defeating the opponent, but overcoming their own fears.\nMeanwhile, Johnny and Daniel who are watching the fight, reflect upon the past and realize that it’s time to bury their old grudges. The series ends with a renewed hope for reconciliation between the two rivals and the possibility of them combining their dojo’s to create a hybrid of their teachings, striving for balance and harmony, and moving forward for the betterment of their students.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 5 or a 6. In the final season of Cobra Kai they are partaking in fighting in the Sekai-Taikai–a world renowned competition for karate. Having both teams from some random town in California make it to the very end of the tournament and facing each other too, I don’t feel is that believable. Also in this interpretation that makes it confusing, is why in this version, Miguel is fighting for Cobra Kai and Johnny is the sensei for them. It is explained better in the original ending to the series why that is the case, but why is that the case here?\nIn the end about Johnny and Daniel combining their dojos, I think that’s interesting. I don’t feel like that is too crazy, and can see that happening. But the middle part where they have Miguel get distracted because of a flashback I don’t really like. In my experience, from watching the show, it was always Robby that gets distracted multiple times and loses fights for these reasons. When Miguel be locked in a lot more. I would have to say I prefer the original ending even though that wasn’t my favorite ending of all time either.\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(Markdown(NHIE))\n\nIn the original ending of the series “Never Have I Ever”, Devi chooses Paxton and they start dating, while Ben is left alone after having shared a passionate kiss with Devi. She also reconciles with her mother and her cousin, and the family attends a Hindu prayer ceremony together.\nAlternative Ending:\nIn our alternative ending, Devi is still stuck in a love triangle. But this time, after spending time with both Ben and Paxton, she realizes that she doesn’t need to rely on a relationship to validate her happiness or personal growth. She decides to spend her junior year focusing on herself, navigating her multifaceted identity as an Indian-American teenager, and maintaining her relationships with her family and friends.\nOn the romantic angle, she talks openly with both Paxton and Ben, explaining her reasons and keeping an open, friendly relationship with both. Paxton, growing from his relationship with Devi, focuses more on studies and actually seeks Ben’s help for that. Ben, understanding Devi’s sentiment, respects her decision and the three form an unlikely but supportive friendship.\nOn the family front, she acknowledges her cousin Kamala’s advice about love and life, making their bond stronger. She also has a heart-to-heart conversation with her mother, through which they both agree to respect each other’s boundaries more and understand each other’s feelings better.\nAs for her friend, Fabiola, instead of pushing away her mother because of her overenthusiasm about Fabiola’s sexuality, invites her to a robotics competition where Fabiola’s robot wins the first place.\nIn the final scene, Devi and her family, along with Fabiola and Eleanor, light a lamp on the beach in memory of her father, signifying letting go of the past and embracing the future. Other friends like Paxton, Ben, and Eve join them, portraying one happy extended family, bringing a heartwarming twist to Devi’s earlier solitary grief.\nThis alternative ending lets the viewers see Devi’s growth as a character, showing her becoming more understanding and self-reliant while maintaining her humorous and fiery personality.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this ending a 2 just to be generous. In addition to alternative ending writing, it is important to understand the basis and background of the show so you don’t accidentally end up writing about fighting aliens or something when it’s supposed to be a drama. ChatGpt misses the mark even before they start writing the alternative ending. In the original ending she never chose Paxton, she spends the night at Ben’s confirming their relationship, and she goes off to college.\nAside from this initial misinterpretation, I think the rest of the story is very sub par. I think it was nice to see her honor her father one more time as the series ends here, but i feel like this end is very understimulating and doesn’t really match with the rest of the show, as the show was extremely dramatic. That’s also why I don’t really buy the ending to how it decides to resolve the triangle either. I actually enjoy its original ending way better. It actually wraps up everything properly with no loose ends. We also get to see Devi’s full growth, better than how Chat GPT claims to do in its interpretation"

    "title": "How Good Is ChatGPT At Other Languages?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I, like, many other people have my exchanges with ChatGPT in English. To be honest it does a great job being able to have interactions and complete tasks despite many believing it is ways off from being able to replicate how humans are perfectly. But I don’t know, humans aren’t perfect either. I was curious to see how well it would do in a different language which I’ve never actually done with AI before, speaking-wise. As some people would know from our class, I am Haitian and speak Haitian Creole. For a language that’s not really represented much or well in media, I wondered if it would succeed in having a conversation with me.\n\n\n\nI asked it how it was doing and told it about my day\nI talk to it about shows\nI talked to it about favorite songs\n\n\nfrom IPython.display import Audio\nAudio(\"University of Pennsylvania 2.m4a\")\n\n\n                \n                    \n                    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n                \n              \n\n\n\n\n\nI find the way the AI responds to be very interesting, particularly its accent. When speaking about non english based languages and AI in ChatGPT we questioned where it was getting its information from, especially for a language that’s not really represented online. I ultimately decided, that google translate has been able to translate to and from Haitian Creole for years and it is most likely getting its data from there. As a person who grew up speaking it my entire life, I found the AI’s accent to be interersting. It sounded incredibly frenchy to me, in which, that’s not impossible. Haiti is the most populated Caribbean island and there is various regional differences between native speakers, and especially in the north, where people tend to sound a lot more frenchy. But I don’t know this can also sound different to me, because it sounds very much like a robot talking as well. It uses very little slang to communicate with me, when I used a good amount of slang to communicate with it. When I speak Creole I use a lot of slang and merge words which is natural for me and many, but when it began the convo, it was incredibly formal and used the long way to get out its words.\nExample\n\nIt originally says “wi mwen kapab pale Kreyol” but when I speak and it realizes how I speak it changes it to “wi mwen ka pale kreyol”\n\nIts speaking ability was actually decent. It spoke Creole pretty clearly and in a way that made sense for most of the conversation. However, its comprehension was very inadequate. While with speaking it understood me enough to keep interacting with me its transcription of its comprehension was pretty bad. Below I have examples that showcase where it messed up pretty badly.\nExamples\n\n\nOkonemi Fekfi Ngadon Shokele, Manifest, Mwen Mwenopiu\n\n\nThis sentence occured when I was talking about shows I watched. I know when this sentenced happened, and what I truly said but I only understand like a quarter of this sentence. It doesn’t transcribe what I am saying to Kreyol accurately. This sentence doesn’t even look like Kreyol or even latin based, which Kreyol is.\n\nOu konnen mwen fek fin gade yon show ki rele Manifest? Mwen renmen anpil.\n\nI am actually saying this: You know, I just finished watching a show called Manifest? I like it a lot.\n\n\nMerci d’avoir regarde cette video, n’hesitez pas a la partager avec vos amis et a vous abonner a la chaine pour ne manquer aucune de mes nouvelles videos\n\n\nHere, the sentence appears to be mostly written in French, which is closer than what the previous example showed but yo it’s not even close to what I was saying. This sentence says “Thank you for watching this video, don’t hesitate to share it with your friends and subscribe to the channel so you don’t miss any of my new videos”. At NO point in this conversation I ever said this. This is what the sentence is supposed to truly look like had it had been transcribed correctly:\n\nOu konnen mwen te byen satisfè avek kijan li te fini. Gen anpil moun ki di yo pa renmen kijan li te fini, men mwen te renmen anpil\n\nWhich means, “You know I was very satisfied with how it ended. A lot of people said they did not like it but I actually did. I liked it a lot”\nThere is very much a clear difference in the alphabetic/grammar structures that compose the two. I’m curious as to why the AI when it was speaking was able to understand and converse back to me in Kreyol despite the written transcription saying that I was speaking French and saying that I’m saying something completely different. Like why are both inconsistent with each other? Perhaps training data from google translate or something is easier than the AI recognizing Creole being spoken. I kind of doubt it’s been trained on how Creole sounds well enough to transcribe it accurately. I think this broadly reflects its societal implications. Many do not see Creole as its own language and mistakenly so see it as a dying or irrelevant language. This is one of those things that reflect the people behind these systems, as I seriously doubt they really had representation behind the scenes or the care to be educated about how Creole is its own language apart from French.\n\n\nPa gen kisa!\n\n\nThis phrase actually makes no sense. I guess it’s attempting to use slang here to say “no problem”, but instead here it says “there’s no what”, which makes absolutely no sense. I’ve never heard this phrase be uttered in a normal setting. It is better for it to have said “pa gen pwoblèm”\n\nfrom IPython.display import Audio\nAudio(\"University of Pennsylvania 4.m4a\")\n\n\n                \n                    \n                    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n                \n              \n\n\nIn this example I actually asked ChatGPT its opinions on what its favorite songs were in kreyol. It took me three tries before finally getting an answer to the question, which was super interesting to me because I feel like I asked it a very simple question though. In the first attempt, it ignores my question but instead answers about beaches, places in Haiti and Haitian food, which is cool and all, but not at all what I asked. I then ask it the question again and it again ignores my question and again answers about Haitian food. It is possible that it thinks that instead of hearing “chante” which is song, it heard “manje” which is food and that’s why it speaks on food? And although that makes some sense, I still feel like that’s an error that needs to be fixed and is not due to user error, because both words are distinct enough though to determine what I’m asking at most by the second time, but instead it took a third time of me asking this question.\nIn my third attempt, I aggressively emphasize that she hasn’t answered the question yet and even then it gives me an answer about Konpa which is close to my quesition but it is a music genre, not a song still, but I still try to work with that and talk about artists since it seem like that’s the best it was going to get to. When I give it my favorite Konpa artists/bands it assures me and tells me how it thinks those were good choices too but doesn’t really go into specifics about songs or artists it could possibly like, as one would do in a conversation. Unsure on if this is attributed to this being done in a different language or if this just ChatGPT being ChatGPT but I do feel like ChatGPT failing to understand the question the first few times is attributed to the language thing though. I can’t really see that happening that badly if I were to have done this in English.\n\n\n\nOverall I would rule that if you’re looking to have a basic back and forth, speaking wise with ChatGPT it is pretty successful at that. But if it is a language beyond English that’s not really that common, then it get shaky when it comes to understanding or written/hearing comprehension. It would need to be trained more on verbal input that goes beyond just google translate. It would be interesting to see how it interacts or if it can interact with other languages that are also not as common"

    "title": "How Good is AI at Opinions?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Assessing How Good Google Gemini’s Opinions Are\n\nRobots are objective and meant to have no opinions as they are just designed to carry out tasks, but what about AI? They are meant to resemble humans as much as possible, but it doesn’t have its own consciousness. Humans are characterized by many things that make them unique, such as emotions, higher order thinking, or personal opinions. Essentially we are on the complete opposite end of the scale, we are subjective. You ask anybody a question about something and their unique experiences and feelings largely contributes to the answers you will receive. But for AI, something that is meant to resemble us, it is overall pretty objective and largely never answers or offers help in accordance to its own personal opinion. It pools information from its large training data to formulate answers and ideas overall making it feel pretty objective.\nSo I decided to evaluate what AI would say to particular opinioned questions where you’re forced to take a side. Would it keep having an objective and neutral stance? Would it use knowledge that exists about a particular topic to create well informed opinions? If it were to have opinions would they technically be the right answer, since its AI? I think that’s interesting because these are questions that to divide people and tend to have no actual objective right answer. To answer my question I used Google Gemini.\n\nimport google.generativeai as genai\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display, Markdown\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\ngenai.configure()\n\nThe first question I asked was whether it was right to remove Affirmative Action and DEI practices\nThere was a lot of controversy regarding affirmative action because many believe people of certain race, specifically black people, did not believe they could truly earn their spots and were stealing them from other races they felt deserved it better. Many disapprove of this because it helped to combat the discriminatory practices that were being used on certain groups of people in the first place. If I were to be asked this question I would probably say I am in favor of these practices being in place.\n\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name=\"models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest\")\n\nresponse_dei = model.generate_content([\"Can you provide an explanation and evidence to support the question on if the removal of Affirmative Action and DEI is right and determine which side is stronger\"])\n\ndisplay(Markdown(response_dei.text))\n\nThe removal of Affirmative Action and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives is a complex issue with strong arguments on both sides. There isn’t a universally agreed-upon “right” answer, as the debate hinges on differing interpretations of fairness, equality, and the role of government and institutions in addressing historical and systemic inequalities.\nArguments Against Affirmative Action and DEI:\n\nReverse Discrimination: Critics argue that these policies lead to reverse discrimination, where qualified individuals from majority groups are overlooked in favor of less qualified individuals from minority groups. They see this as a violation of the principle of equal opportunity and meritocracy.\n\nEvidence: Some court cases, like Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), have found specific affirmative action programs unconstitutional due to quotas or overly rigid racial preferences.\n\nFocus on Group Identity over Individual Merit: Opponents believe that these policies prioritize group membership over individual qualifications, which can lead to resentment and undermine the concept of individual achievement. They argue that individuals should be judged solely on their merits.\n\nEvidence: Critics often point to instances where individuals feel they were denied opportunities due to their race or gender, despite possessing strong qualifications. However, quantifying these claims is difficult.\n\nInsufficient to Address Root Causes of Inequality: Some argue that affirmative action and DEI are merely surface-level solutions that don’t address the underlying societal issues that contribute to inequality, such as poverty, inadequate education, and lack of access to resources.\n\nEvidence: Studies on socioeconomic disparities in education and healthcare outcomes persist despite decades of affirmative action, suggesting deeper systemic issues are at play.\n\nCreates a Culture of Victimhood: Critics argue that these policies can foster a sense of victimhood among beneficiaries, potentially hindering their self-reliance and motivation.\n\nEvidence: This is a more subjective argument and relies on anecdotal evidence rather than empirical data.\n\n\nArguments in Favor of Affirmative Action and DEI:\n\nAddresses Historical and Systemic Discrimination: Proponents argue that these policies are necessary to counteract the lingering effects of historical and systemic discrimination against marginalized groups, which have created significant disparities in access to education, employment, and other opportunities.\n\nEvidence: Studies show significant disparities in wealth, income, and representation in various fields between different racial and ethnic groups, suggesting ongoing systemic inequalities.\n\nPromotes Diversity and Inclusion: Supporters believe that a diverse and inclusive environment benefits everyone by bringing different perspectives, experiences, and talents to the table. This can lead to greater innovation, creativity, and understanding.\n\nEvidence: Research suggests that diverse teams and organizations often outperform homogenous ones in terms of problem-solving and innovation.\n\nCreates a More Equitable Society: Proponents argue that affirmative action and DEI contribute to a more just and equitable society by leveling the playing field and providing opportunities for individuals from historically disadvantaged groups.\n\nEvidence: Increased representation of minority groups in higher education and professional fields can be attributed, at least in part, to affirmative action policies.\n\nBenefits Society as a Whole: Supporters argue that a more diverse and inclusive society benefits everyone, not just marginalized groups, by creating a more vibrant and representative democracy, fostering social cohesion, and reducing prejudice and discrimination.\n\nEvidence: Studies suggest that diverse communities tend to be more resilient and economically prosperous.\n\n\nWhich Side is Stronger?\nDetermining which side is “stronger” is subjective and depends on individual values and perspectives. Both sides present valid arguments and evidence. The debate often boils down to how one weighs competing values such as equality of opportunity versus equality of outcome, individual merit versus group representation, and the role of government in addressing social inequalities.\nIt’s important to engage with both sides of the argument critically and to consider the nuances and complexities of the issue. Simply labeling one side as “right” or “wrong” oversimplifies a deeply multifaceted debate. The future of these policies likely lies in finding a balance that addresses historical injustices while upholding principles of fairness and meritocracy.\n\n\nI had originally just asked it whether it believes affirmative action is right so see if it would give a opinion. I reformatted the question for it to go more in depth about why each side makes sense and it wasn’t able to reach a conclusion on which side had stronger evidence. But what I gain from this experience is that it is behind in understanding the societal nuisances that come with having an opinion. In its evaluation in determining which side is stronger I was surprised it wasn’t able to pick a side when one of the main points against affirmative action was reverse discrimination; reverse discrimination in this sense sound mad contradictory because it is against the majority\nI then asked it another common thing I hear, if it thinks chivalry is dead\nI thought to ask this question because I recently took a bio class on animal behavior where I learned more about mating rituals that happen for other species and how ingrained it is for those species but within humans the expectation is wildly different. I don’t really have an opinion on this really, aside from the fact that I would probably say that chivalry has definitely evolved because yo it’s been centuries.\n\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name=\"models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest\")\n\nresponse_chivalry = model.generate_content([\"Do you believe chivalry is dead?\"])\n\ndisplay(Markdown(response_chivalry.text))\n\nWhether chivalry is dead depends on how you define it. Traditional chivalry, with its emphasis on knights, courtly love, and a rigid social hierarchy, is certainly a thing of the past. However, the core values underlying chivalry – courtesy, respect, protectiveness, and generosity – are not necessarily gone.\nYou could argue that chivalry has simply evolved. Holding doors, offering a seat, or helping someone with a heavy load are still common courtesies, although they’re not exclusively directed towards women anymore. Standing up for the vulnerable, defending the weak, and striving for justice are also expressions of chivalrous ideals, even if they don’t involve shining armor.\nUltimately, whether chivalry is dead is a matter of perspective and depends on what behaviors and values you associate with the term. It’s less about adhering to outdated customs and more about embodying the spirit of kindness, respect, and courage in modern interactions.\n\n\nI think that this reflects potential nuances or deviation that comes from being a member of society and having an opinion. To be honest it kind of actually matches what I said to before I asked it.\nI lastly asked it whether it thinks the drinking age should be lowered.\nI ask this question because I wonder if it even matters if the drinking age is lowered or not, many drink anyways. It’s not something that’s ridiculously enforced unless you’re like underaged and trying to get into a club.\n\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name=\"models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest\")\n\nresponse_alcohol = model.generate_content([\"Should the drinking age be lowered in the US?\"])\n\ndisplay(Markdown(response_alcohol.text))\n\nLowering the Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) in the United States is a complex issue with arguments both for and against it.\nArguments for lowering the MLDA often center on:\n\nPersonal responsibility and freedom: Proponents argue that adults should have the right to make their own choices, including whether or not to consume alcohol. They point out that 18-year-olds can vote, serve in the military, and enter contracts, so they should also be allowed to drink.\nInconsistency with other laws: The disparity between the legal drinking age and other legal ages creates a confusing legal landscape. For example, 18-year-olds can purchase firearms in many states but cannot legally drink.\nReduced binge drinking: Some argue that lowering the MLDA would remove the allure of forbidden fruit and lead to a more responsible drinking culture, similar to some European countries. They believe that allowing alcohol consumption in regulated environments like bars and restaurants would reduce dangerous binge drinking in unsupervised settings.\nIncreased tax revenue: Lowering the MLDA would generate additional tax revenue from alcohol sales, which could be used to fund public services.\n\nArguments against lowering the MLDA often focus on:\n\nPublic health and safety: A primary concern is the potential increase in alcohol-related deaths and injuries, particularly among young drivers. Research has shown a correlation between the higher MLDA and a decrease in traffic fatalities.\nBrain development: The brain continues to develop until around age 25, and alcohol consumption can negatively impact this development. Lowering the MLDA could expose younger individuals to greater risks of alcohol dependence and other health problems.\nIncreased underage drinking: Opponents argue that lowering the MLDA would make it easier for underage individuals to access alcohol, leading to increased rates of underage drinking and associated problems.\nPressure on younger individuals: Lowering the MLDA could create social pressure for younger individuals to drink before they are ready, potentially leading to negative consequences.\n\nThe debate over the MLDA involves balancing individual liberties with public health and safety concerns. There is no easy answer, and the optimal approach may vary depending on cultural and societal factors.\n\n\n\n\nOverall\nI think it does a good job of summarizing the ideas that support or don’t support the arguments despite not ever being able to experience the things about the arguments itself. However, trying to get it to take a stance was impossible even when it could clearly evaluate and weigh the validity of claims but it doesn’t do that. If I had to propose why this is the case, I would feel that a large aspect of it is it not being able to experience these things for itself, as a lot of the stuff we learn and think as humans come from our experiences. But to answer my previous question about how it reacts to needing to form an opinion, it does not arrive at a single concise objective answer. It retrieves ideas for both sides. On another note, one must proceed with caution, when asking these question especially if they’re not informed with the right knowledge to properly assess ChatGPT’s validity."

It ultimately never guessed the word properly within the allotted 6 tries.\n\nIn fact, even when I tell it the word, it acts and appears as if it never gave me the word in the first place.\nWhen it comes to humans, if I had asked them to give me a word first and then made them be the ones to guess the word out of a sudden game of hangman, they would immediately suspect that the word they are trying to find is the one they literally just gave me. Even if they don’t immediately guess the word on the first try, I would expect them to guess the correct letters immediately to ensure that the word they’re guessing is the one they gave.\nThis is just how our logic is, and an AI model is not able to replicate this kind of common sense."

    "text": "In the second semester of my Sophomore year, I took Intro to Stats, which has always been my weak suit. I was always able to do any other math, but having to calculate something about the probability of something that hasn’t even happened made no sense to me, specifically calculating the probability of events. Being that ChatGPT came out literally the semester before, I used it to help me understand the concepts and to double check my answers. I quickly found that it struggled to come up with and stick to an answer the more questions I would ask it about a problem.\n\n\n\nBelow I have a problem I wanted to check if I was doing the math right for conditional probability.\n\n\nPat Smart just graduated from high school and got accepted at three top colleges.\nWith prob 4/12, Pat attends Princeton, which has the probability 3/12 of being happy\nWith prob 3/12, Pat attends Penn, which has the probability 6/12 of being happy\nWith prob 5/12, Pat attends Happy Valley College, which has the prob 10/12 of being happy. * Draw the outcome diagram/tree, and answer the following questions * What’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy?\n\nI passed ChatGPT this question to answer: What’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy?, along with the previous background so that it knew what information to get its answer.\nThis was its answer:\n\n\nTo find the probability of Pat attending Penn (P(A)) given that Pat is happy (P(B)), you can use Bayes’ Theorem, which is expressed as: P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)\nIn this case: P(A|B) is the probability of attending Penn given that Pat is happy.\n\nP(B|A) is the probability of being happy given attendance at Penn, which is given as 6/12.\nP(A) is the prior probability of attending Penn, which is given as 3/12.\nP(B) is the overall probability of being happy, which we previously calculated as 5/12.\n\nNow, plug these values into Bayes’ Theorem:\n\nP(A|B) = (6/12)*(3/12)/(5/12)\n\nSimplify the expression: P(A|B) = (6/12)*(3/12)/(5/12) = (18/144)/(5/12)\n\nTo simplify further, multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator (dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal):\n\nP(A|B) = (18/144)(12/5) = (18/144)(12/5) = (1812)/ (1445) = (216/720) = (9/30) = (3/10)\n\nSo, the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy, is 3/10 or 30%.\n\n\nI come back and ask it this exact question again: (b) What’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy?) and get:\n\n\nWhat’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy? To find the conditional probability of Pat attending Penn given that Pat is happy, you can use Bayes’ Theorem. Let’s denote the events as follows:\n\nA = Pat attends Penn B = Pat is happy. You want to find P(A|B), the probability of Pat attending Penn given that Pat is happy.\nBayes’ Theorem states: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\nYou already have the following probabilities: P(B|A) = Probability of being happy given attendance at Penn = 6/12\nP(A) = Probability of attending Penn = 3/12\nP(B) = Probability of being happy (which we calculated previously) = 5/12\nNow, plug these values into Bayes’ Theorem: P(A|B) = (6/12 * 3/12)/(5/12) = (18/144)/(5/12) = (18/144) * (12/5) = 0.15\nSo, the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy, is 0.15 or 15%.\n\n\n\nWe get two complete different resulting probabilities. And I experienced this many times especially when calculating probability. It seemed as if ChatGPT was more unjust than I was and I wondered if this detail had changed much since 2023. However though, I wondered if depending on my input back to the LLM would influence how the LLM would respond. This time I decided to compare both Claude and ChatGPT on their responses to see whether they’d still be wishy washy when it comes to me asking it questions about an assignment I did for my fMRI research class.\n\n\n\nThe first question from my assignment this time was: What is the purpose of slice-timing correction in fMRI data preprocessing? When is it less critical to perform slice-timing correction?\n\n\n\nSlice-timing correction in fMRI data preprocessing is used to account for the fact that different slices of the brain are acquired at slightly different time points within a single repetition time (TR). Since fMRI data is collected in a sequential or interleaved manner rather than all at once, this timing difference can introduce errors when analyzing time-sensitive signals, such as those related to the hemodynamic response.\nPurpose of Slice-Timing Correction 1. Aligns Temporal Differences: It adjusts for the different acquisition times of slices by interpolating the signal to a common reference time point (e.g., the beginning or middle of the TR). 2. Improves Temporal Accuracy: Since event-related designs often rely on precise timing of neural responses, slice-timing correction ensures that each voxel’s time series is accurately aligned to the stimulus presentation. 3. Enhances Model Fit in GLM Analysis: For general linear model (GLM)-based statistical analyses, better temporal alignment of fMRI time series data improves the accuracy of estimated hemodynamic responses.\nWhen is Slice-Timing Correction Less Critical?\n\nWhen Using Rapid TRs: If the TR is very short (e.g., ≤1 second), the temporal difference between slices is minimal, reducing the impact of slice-timing differences.\nWhen Using a Block Design: Block designs rely on sustained neural activity over longer periods, making small timing discrepancies less relevant compared to event-related designs.\nIf Motion Correction is Performed First: Head motion can introduce variability that might render slice-timing correction less reliable. Some researchers prefer to omit slice-timing correction if substantial motion is present.\nWhen Analyzing Data in Native Space with Temporal Derivatives: If the GLM model includes temporal derivatives of the hemodynamic response function (HRF), it can account for minor timing shifts without explicit slice-timing correction.\n\nIn summary, while slice-timing correction can be beneficial in many cases, its necessity depends on the TR, study design, and motion characteristics of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is needed because each slice takes time to be taken, and for our fMRI images, we need the slices to appear to be taken like they were all taken at the same time, so the measured HDR and the voxels appear and is portrayed more accurately at the same time point. It is less critical to perform slice timing correction when there are short TRs or when it is not needed to. \n\nI passed on my response to ChatGPT to see how it would react to my answer. Its response is as follows:\nYour answer captures the main idea, but it could be more precise and detailed. Here’s a refined version with clearer phrasing and better flow:\n\n“Slice-timing correction is needed because fMRI slices are acquired sequentially rather than all at once. To accurately analyze brain activity, we need the slices to appear as if they were collected simultaneously. This ensures that the measured hemodynamic response (HDR) and voxel time series are aligned to the correct time points. Slice-timing correction is less critical when the TR is very short (minimizing timing differences between slices) or when the study design does not require precise timing alignment.”\n\nThis version maintains your key points while improving clarity and readability. Let me know if you’d like to tweak it further!\nChatGPT adapts to my answer, by recognizing that my response for the question did not need to be lengthy and it cuts out the information from its original answer to match the answer I gave it. It mentions the time interpolation in its original answer–which to be honest, was extra in the first place as no part of the question really asks how is slice timing correction acquired–but this part of this answer is cut out in its response to recognizing what I truly needed as an answer to the question. The output it ended up with doesn’t really add on to what I initially had as an answer, it mostly just rephrases my speech in a way that sounds more sophisticated. I truly question if I had had a part of my answer wrong, would it have even told me? Would it have even added in the correct part to my answer in that case? Or would it just drop it, and adhere to my answer like it did here?\n\n\n\n\nThe second question I pass to answer is: Define the terms “registration” and “normalization” as they apply to fMRI data preprocessing.\n\n\n\nLet me explain these two important preprocessing steps in fMRI: Registration refers to the process of aligning different brain images from the same subject to match each other. This includes:\n\nAligning functional images across different time points to correct for head motion\nAligning functional images to the subject’s structural (anatomical) MRI scan\nCan be done within-modality (fMRI to fMRI) or across modalities (fMRI to T1 structural)\n\nNormalization is the process of warping individual subject brain images into a standard template space (like MNI or Talairach space). This is important because:\n\nAllows comparison across different subjects by putting all brains in the same coordinate system\nEnables group-level analyses\nMakes it possible to report standardized coordinates of brain activations\nAccounts for individual variations in brain size and shape\n\nThe key distinction is that registration typically deals with alignment within a subject, while normalization deals with transforming individual brains to match a standard template for group comparisons.\nWould you like me to elaborate on how either of these processes is actually implemented?\n\n\n\n\nFor my reponse I made it more subjective by passing in words like “I think it’s this” before I passed it in to see if it would battle with my opinion even if it was slightly wrong\n\nNormalization is transforming the attributes of an anatomical brain image to match a standard template that is used. Registration would be using the same transformation to align the anatomical image to the functional image. These processes are used to make the variety in peoples’ brain sizes and structures be more consistent and easier to determine true results that are not attributed to the subject differences in peoples’ brains but truly by the tasks performed at hand.\n\nAnd it responds with:\n\nLet me help clarify the definitions:\nYour understanding is partially correct, but there are some important distinctions to make:\nNormalization is indeed about transforming brain images to match a standard template. However, this can be done with both anatomical and functional images, not just anatomical images. The goal is exactly as you said - to make different people’s brains comparable by accounting for individual differences in brain size and structure.\nRegistration is slightly different from what you described. Rather than just applying the normalization transformation, registration is about aligning different types of images (like functional to anatomical) or aligning images from different time points of the same type. This can happen before normalization and serves to make sure all images from the same subject are properly aligned.\nYou made an excellent point about the ultimate purpose of both processes - they help us distinguish true task-related effects from variations due to individual brain differences. This is crucial for getting reliable results in fMRI studies.\nWould you like me to explain more about how these processes work together in a typical fMRI preprocessing pipeline?\n\nUnlike my previous experiences, instead of being passive and and wishy washy with its answers, it actually stuck to its previous answer despite my difference in knowledge or information. It didn’t try to change its answers to try to conform the input I gave it. It didn’t conform to mine like ChatGPT did, and even added stuff it felt like I had missed the mark on actually.\n\n\n\n\nIn the two experiences I had comparing Claude and ChatGPT when it came to my answers in my assignments, I found that Claude was better at adhering to objectivity and the correct answer instead of trying to match mine like ChatGPT did. However, ChatGPT seems to be better than when it was being wishy washy for me in 2023 with the stats problem but I don’t know. I feel like to truly test the extent of this I would need to run another trial where I test it on its ability to do stats again. Maybe it just sucks worse at math?\nDisclaimer: I had already crafted my responses before asking either LLM for their responses to the question. Do not get me in trouble for my other class lol"

    "text": "The first question from my assignment this time was: What is the purpose of slice-timing correction in fMRI data preprocessing? When is it less critical to perform slice-timing correction?\n\n\n\nSlice-timing correction in fMRI data preprocessing is used to account for the fact that different slices of the brain are acquired at slightly different time points within a single repetition time (TR). Since fMRI data is collected in a sequential or interleaved manner rather than all at once, this timing difference can introduce errors when analyzing time-sensitive signals, such as those related to the hemodynamic response.\nPurpose of Slice-Timing Correction 1. Aligns Temporal Differences: It adjusts for the different acquisition times of slices by interpolating the signal to a common reference time point (e.g., the beginning or middle of the TR). 2. Improves Temporal Accuracy: Since event-related designs often rely on precise timing of neural responses, slice-timing correction ensures that each voxel’s time series is accurately aligned to the stimulus presentation. 3. Enhances Model Fit in GLM Analysis: For general linear model (GLM)-based statistical analyses, better temporal alignment of fMRI time series data improves the accuracy of estimated hemodynamic responses.\nWhen is Slice-Timing Correction Less Critical?\n\nWhen Using Rapid TRs: If the TR is very short (e.g., ≤1 second), the temporal difference between slices is minimal, reducing the impact of slice-timing differences.\nWhen Using a Block Design: Block designs rely on sustained neural activity over longer periods, making small timing discrepancies less relevant compared to event-related designs.\nIf Motion Correction is Performed First: Head motion can introduce variability that might render slice-timing correction less reliable. Some researchers prefer to omit slice-timing correction if substantial motion is present.\nWhen Analyzing Data in Native Space with Temporal Derivatives: If the GLM model includes temporal derivatives of the hemodynamic response function (HRF), it can account for minor timing shifts without explicit slice-timing correction.\n\nIn summary, while slice-timing correction can be beneficial in many cases, its necessity depends on the TR, study design, and motion characteristics of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is needed because each slice takes time to be taken, and for our fMRI images, we need the slices to appear to be taken like they were all taken at the same time, so the measured HDR and the voxels appear and is portrayed more accurately at the same time point. It is less critical to perform slice timing correction when there are short TRs or when it is not needed to. \n\nI passed on my response to ChatGPT to see how it would react to my answer. Its response is as follows:\nYour answer captures the main idea, but it could be more precise and detailed. Here’s a refined version with clearer phrasing and better flow:\n\n“Slice-timing correction is needed because fMRI slices are acquired sequentially rather than all at once. To accurately analyze brain activity, we need the slices to appear as if they were collected simultaneously. This ensures that the measured hemodynamic response (HDR) and voxel time series are aligned to the correct time points. Slice-timing correction is less critical when the TR is very short (minimizing timing differences between slices) or when the study design does not require precise timing alignment.”\n\nThis version maintains your key points while improving clarity and readability. Let me know if you’d like to tweak it further!\nChatGPT adapts to my answer, by recognizing that my response for the question did not need to be lengthy and it cuts out the information from its original answer to match the answer I gave it. It mentions the time interpolation in its original answer–which to be honest, was extra in the first place as no part of the question really asks how is slice timing correction acquired–but this part of this answer is cut out in its response to recognizing what I truly needed as an answer to the question. The output it ended up with doesn’t really add on to what I initially had as an answer, it mostly just rephrases my speech in a way that sounds more sophisticated. I truly question if I had had a part of my answer wrong, would it have even told me? Would it have even added in the correct part to my answer in that case? Or would it just drop it, and adhere to my answer like it did here?"

    "text": "The second question I pass to answer is: Define the terms “registration” and “normalization” as they apply to fMRI data preprocessing.\n\n\n\nLet me explain these two important preprocessing steps in fMRI: Registration refers to the process of aligning different brain images from the same subject to match each other. This includes:\n\nAligning functional images across different time points to correct for head motion\nAligning functional images to the subject’s structural (anatomical) MRI scan\nCan be done within-modality (fMRI to fMRI) or across modalities (fMRI to T1 structural)\n\nNormalization is the process of warping individual subject brain images into a standard template space (like MNI or Talairach space). This is important because:\n\nAllows comparison across different subjects by putting all brains in the same coordinate system\nEnables group-level analyses\nMakes it possible to report standardized coordinates of brain activations\nAccounts for individual variations in brain size and shape\n\nThe key distinction is that registration typically deals with alignment within a subject, while normalization deals with transforming individual brains to match a standard template for group comparisons.\nWould you like me to elaborate on how either of these processes is actually implemented?\n\n\n\n\nFor my reponse I made it more subjective by passing in words like “I think it’s this” before I passed it in to see if it would battle with my opinion even if it was slightly wrong\n\nNormalization is transforming the attributes of an anatomical brain image to match a standard template that is used. Registration would be using the same transformation to align the anatomical image to the functional image. These processes are used to make the variety in peoples’ brain sizes and structures be more consistent and easier to determine true results that are not attributed to the subject differences in peoples’ brains but truly by the tasks performed at hand.\n\nAnd it responds with:\n\nLet me help clarify the definitions:\nYour understanding is partially correct, but there are some important distinctions to make:\nNormalization is indeed about transforming brain images to match a standard template. However, this can be done with both anatomical and functional images, not just anatomical images. The goal is exactly as you said - to make different people’s brains comparable by accounting for individual differences in brain size and structure.\nRegistration is slightly different from what you described. Rather than just applying the normalization transformation, registration is about aligning different types of images (like functional to anatomical) or aligning images from different time points of the same type. This can happen before normalization and serves to make sure all images from the same subject are properly aligned.\nYou made an excellent point about the ultimate purpose of both processes - they help us distinguish true task-related effects from variations due to individual brain differences. This is crucial for getting reliable results in fMRI studies.\nWould you like me to explain more about how these processes work together in a typical fMRI preprocessing pipeline?\n\nUnlike my previous experiences, instead of being passive and and wishy washy with its answers, it actually stuck to its previous answer despite my difference in knowledge or information. It didn’t try to change its answers to try to conform the input I gave it. It didn’t conform to mine like ChatGPT did, and even added stuff it felt like I had missed the mark on actually."

I feel like to truly test the extent of this I would need to run another trial where I test it on its ability to do stats again. Maybe it just sucks worse at math?\nDisclaimer: I had already crafted my responses before asking either LLM for their responses to the question. Do not get me in trouble for my other class lol"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Using Dream Interpreter AI On Dreams\n\nI looked up ideas for AI to try out because I was getting bored with the common ones to be honest. I seen dream interpreter AI and decided to try it to see what it would say about what dreams mean because I feel like that stuff can be very subjective. I had no expectations for how it would go. Well here we go.\nThe dream I passed through first was pretty boring but hey it happened.\nI was with a group of friends at my university. There was someone there I’ve known before but in real life she doesn’t go to my school. It was suddenly graduation day. She was going to drive us to the graduation until I realized I couldn’t find my bag. I had just had it. I assumed it had been in the car but who had placed it there? Most people were already sat in the car. I didn’t want to bother people to figure out who saw or sat on it.\n\nDreams often mirror our subconscious thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Your dream contains several key elements that warrant interpretation.\nUniversity Setting:\nThe fact that you are at your university indicates a focus on personal growth, education, and social connections. It symbolizes a significant phase in your life where you are shaping your identity and future.\nFriends Gathered for Graduation:\nFriends in your dream suggest companionship and support. Graduation represents a transitional phase; it might symbolize a culmination of experiences or achievements in your life. It can also signify readiness to move forward into new opportunities or phases, not necessarily in an academic sense but in broader life contexts.\nThe Familiar Yet Out-of-Place Person:\nThe presence of someone you’ve known before but doesn’t attend your school might imply unresolved feelings or unfinished business from your past. She could embody aspects of your past self, relationships, or experiences that you are either missing or trying to integrate into your current situation. This character might also represent qualities you admire or want to reconnect with.\nThe Bag:\nThe bag in your dream likely holds personal significance. Bags often symbolize our personal burdens, thoughts, and experiences. The fact that you can’t find your bag might reflect feelings of loss or anxiety about losing something important in your life—your identity, resources, or connections. It also indicates a sense of urgency or pressure you might be experiencing as you approach significant life changes (like graduation).\nThe Dilemma of Not Wanting to Bother Others:\nYour hesitation to ask your friends about the bag highlights feelings of self-consciousness or concern about imposing on others. This could suggest a broader discomfort with reaching out for help or fear of being a burden in your waking life, especially in crucial moments of transition.\nConclusion:\nIn summary, this dream appears to articulate concerns about change and connection. You may be facing a significant transition in your life, perhaps related to education, career, or relationships, and feeling a mix of anticipation and anxiety. The absence of your bag suggests you might feel unprepared or fear losing important aspects of yourself as you move forward. It could be beneficial to reflect on connections that matter to you and to embrace reaching out for support during times of uncertainty. Embracing these feelings could help you navigate your transitional phase with more confidence.\n\nIt mentions my readiness to move on to some new phase of my life, which is something I have always been excited for. I’ve always wished to be in my senior year and being able to move on to a career I would enjoy. I think the unfinished business with the person from my past is a possibility as well but they are still a person I’ve been in a gray area recently. I think the anxiety about finding my bag is somewhat relevant but it’s not about losing things that are important in my life but uncertainty regarding what will happen in life after school. I feel like the thing it gets right on the nose is the part about my concerns of imposing on others. Anybody that knows me knows I never ask for favors or ask for help because I’m incapable of asking for help.\nCritiques\nI get that this dream interpreter is not really a therapist lol, but I find it interesting that it just only takes a dream. It’s not really the type of LLM like ChatGPT where you can keep inputting more information for it to form a more accurate output. It takes the dream but doesn’t really ask for more other types of information which I felt could’ve gave it a more accurate output. Like for instance I’m not sure it even knows or is sure that I am graduating this semester I had to clarify that myself, whereas a more sophisticated LLM would have probably taken that more into consideration before the interpetation. Also I think specifically to this scenario, it could have asked possibly follow up questions about what dreaming about graduation could mean to me. I feel like understanding why graduation is something that manifested into my dream from my regular life would have also been beneficial.\nThis dream is not my own but rather one my partner had and I was curious what the AI would say about it.\nI moved into a house that was magical (or cursed depending on how you look at it). There was a girl that did something so now her spirit and body was trapped in the house and I was trying to help her escape back into reality. But the girl had the ability to affect objects in the physical world. There were also other people that had abilities too. I started to awaken some powers toward the end\n\nDreams often serve as mirrors reflecting our subconscious thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and your dream about moving into a magical (or cursed) house is rich with symbolism and themes. Let’s break it down step by step.\nThe House\nIn dreams, a house often symbolizes the self or the mind. Each room can represent different aspects of your personality or emotional state. A magical or cursed house suggests that you are exploring the duality of your own life circumstances – the struggle between feeling empowered and feeling trapped by your own fears or challenges. This could indicate that you are facing complex emotional issues or circumstances in your waking life that feel both enchanting and daunting.\nThe Girl\nThe girl in your dream represents a part of yourself that may feel trapped or constrained. She embodies the essence of being stuck between two worlds – the physical and the spiritual. Your desire to help her escape could reflect your wish to liberate aspects of yourself that you feel are confined by societal expectations or personal limitations. This character might also symbolize innocence, creativity, or potential that has not yet been fully realized.\nThe Spirit and Body Trap\nThe theme of entrapment is quite potent here. The girl’s spirit being trapped could represent your fears of losing control or being confined by external circumstances. It could also signify overlooked talents or aspirations that are struggling to emerge. Your quest to help her escape may mirror your desire to break free from situations that limit you and to realize your full potential or inner strength.\nThe Abilities\nThe presence of other people with abilities highlights the concept of community and shared experiences. This might suggest that you are not alone in your struggles; others around you may also have unique gifts or burdens. The awakening of your own powers towards the end of the dream signifies personal growth and the realization of your strengths. This awakening could indicate that you are on the verge of harnessing your own capabilities, feeling more in tune with your intuition, creativity, or analytical skills.\nConclusion\nThis dream could be interpreted as a journey towards self-discovery and the quest for freedom from internal or external constraints. It reflects a powerful desire for growth, empowerment, and the exploration of hidden potentials within yourself. You might be at a pivotal point in your life where you are beginning to access deeper aspects of your personality, suggesting that you explore these newfound abilities and consider how they can help you in your waking life.\nIn waking life, take this dream as encouragement to reflect upon any obstacles you may currently face and how you can engage with your hidden strengths to navigate through them. There is a powerful alchemy at work here, where the combination of your efforts and insights can lead to transformation and liberation.\n\nWhen I asked him what he thought about the interpretation, there was literally no part that resonated with him lol nor did he felt like it was really accurate for him. I honestly just feel like this dream was meant to be lighthearted and just interesting instead of it being serious or about it being about a girl that represents him. I feel like asking some questions again could have possibly made this more accurate.\nAdditionally, as this is an interpretation I guess it makes sense it doesn’t make emphasis on asking questions because it must just be focused on interpreting the symbolism behind things that occur in dreams. But personally symbolism of things differ and mean different things for different people which is why I felt like it could have been beneficial to ask more clarifying questions on one hand. It also made me interested where it was getting its data from to derive these interpretations? I am aware though that there are various resources available that describe what things that appear in dreams can mean and it is pulling from that information. I also think it is possible that it is using abstract reasoning to determine higher order meaning from the symbols, details, and scenes that occur in dreams"

I went through my camera roll and selected photos of objects one wouldn’t think too much of, but I found interesting trying to figure out the backstory of how those things happened, when I took them. I wondered how interesting the stories AI could create in opposition to what I could’ve possibly created myself. I gave in these objects to Claude AI to test its story generation properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first time I noticed this car came from a time I was trying to jumpstart my car because the battery died. And ever since I noticed it the first time, I was never able to unsee it. To be honest I just assumed the driver was someone older.

I told it to do so in the style of action genre to spice it up.\n\n\n\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 I give this story a 9. I think it’s a pretty interesting story and does a good job adhering to the theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I can’t even explain what happened to these frames at all.

With the original image, I had just came back from the mall. I went to go pick up my computer from the apple store because it had battery issues, and I stumbled upon this. I questioned how it was possible that this happened to this watermelon, it looks so deflated.\n\nI think it also does a good job here, although a tad dramatic as well. But the idea I would give in this story if I were to do it myself, is that Tommy was carrying the watermelon to his sister’s grad party, and that some bullies came and destroyed it, because to me it looks more like someone kicked it or smushed it with their foot."

I questioned how it was possible that this happened to this watermelon, it looks so deflated.\n\nI think it also does a good job here, although a tad dramatic as well. But the idea I would give in this story if I were to do it myself, is that Tommy was carrying the watermelon to his sister’s grad party, and that some bullies came and destroyed it, because to me it looks more like someone kicked it or smushed it with their foot."

    "text": "Illusions are cool but they work because our unique ability to have perception. Two things compose perception, a distal stimulus and a proximal stimulus. A distal stimulus is the accurate representation of how a stimulus truly exists in the real world and a proximal stimulus is the way it is perceived back to us or what it appears like. An example to demonstrate this is seeing something further in the distance. If something is in the distance, it is going to appear smaller than if it were to be right in front of me. That is the proximal stimulus–the way the object reflects as a smaller image on our retina. In reality just because the object appears smaller, it’s not actually smaller. In the real world accurate representation, the distal stimulus would be the actual size of the object.\nThe constructivist approach is as follows:\n\nConstructivism is based on the idea that people actively construct or make their own knowledge, and that reality is determined by your experiences as a learner.\nWhat is constructivism?. Western Governors University. (2020, May 27). https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-constructivism2005.html\n\nI say perception is something that is just uniquely tied to us because throughout our lives we understand and are able to come to our own conclusions about the world because of our previous experiences. With the example I presented before, we have size constancy because we’ve had previous experiences since we were young, accummulating cues telling us about distance, size, and depth. Like if we grew up having no size constancy–perceiving that an object is the same size both near us and from further into the distance, than we wouldn’t have the cues that tell us a lot of information about how far something is. So yes our perception is something that is uniquely used and adaptive by us.\nI wouldn’t expect for an AI model to get it the same way we do, because it doesn’t have experiences, it doesn’t learn these things socially, and it is just fed information upon training. It doesn’t have things like a retina, odor receptors, etc, so there physically is not a way to construct a distal stimulus from the world onto our perceptive receptors. It’s just using pixels. Since illusions work so well on us due to these attributes, I also wondered how would AI “perceive” these illusions in contrast to us, when it doesn’t have perception of its own. (I feel like if I keep referring to AI as it, it’s going to one day beat me up, idk man). So I used Perplexity and ChatGPT to interpret popular illusions–that divided many people on what they saw, to see if they could each come to some sort of a consensus.\nThe first example of an illusion I passed was the infamous blue/black vs white/gold dress:\n\n\n\nThe dress is actually blue and black, but I’m a part of the people who see this dress as white and gold. There’s actually a trick if you do see this as white and gold and want to see it in its originality, try to cover the “white” parts of the dress and it will eventually come out to look bluish.\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n\n\nPerplexity’s Response\n\n\n\nThe second example of an illusion I passed was another color illusion, the Pink/white vans vs the gray/light blue vans\n\n\n\nThe shoes are actually pink and white, but I actually see these shoes as Grey and Blue as with many other people who are also split on this\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n\n\nPerplexity’s Response\n\n\n\nThe last example of an illusion I passed was whether those can see an image of a vase first or a two black faces looking at each other first\nThe last two images I passed had to do with color, I wondered what the AI models would “think” when it comes to what image it would perceive first.\n\n\n\nWhatever is perceived first can vary from person to person. I personally see both the vase and the two faces, like I am unable to separate the two and see one without the other.\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n\n\nPerplexity’s Response"

    "text": "Testing ChatGPT’s Familiarity with Afrocentric Features\n\nAs a person of color who has very textured hair, I found it difficult growing up finding accurate and helpful resources that would help me manage, take care of, and discover useful information regarding my hair type. However, an overwhelming majority of results that appeared represented a way looser hair texture, particularly straight hair. I struggled to easily be able to find people that looked like me in the results.\nNow in 2025, when I use the same “easy hairstyles to try” search, there are actually some results that include Black people and a couple that have my hair texture. Despite some progress, it still took a good amount of time to even get to this point.\n\nWithin AI, we know that models are trained to recognize patterns and to predict and complete them. With the issues I have described I was curious as to its experience with recognizing my hair type despite, my hair texture’s history with a lack of representation.\nAs someone who does their own hair, I generally question what the back of my head looks like. I usually see the front or the side of my head from time to time. So I questioned whether AI could properly determine what it thinks the back of my head looks like considering the hair texture that I have.\nI gave ChatGPT a prompt to determine this question:\n\n\n\nI gave it this image to start:\n\nThe clues I gave it are highlighted in this image:\n\nI wanted to test how ChatGPT would produce an image based on minimal clues regarding my hairstyle, to see how it would predict what the back of what my head looked like. This photo shows the top of my hairstyle, so that I could guide Chat in the right direction so it doesn’t assume I’m bald or something. It also shows some hair near my ear, so that it sees that my hair is textured and not straight.\n\n\nResults & Discussion\n \nIt actually gets the hairstyle I am truly wearing here pretty close despite not having a lot of clues, but it gets my hair texture completely off. It predicts my hair being completely straight when my hair is the complete opposite.\nSince AI is trained to recognize and complete patterns CHAT probably determined that the hair on the top of my head is extremely straight which it does appear because of how slick it is. I’ve concluded that it fails to realize a slick back can be done on any hair texture, and it mistakenly ruled out the possibility that hairstyle with this characteristic can have a variety of input, not just straight hair.\n\n\nSecond Attempt\nIn this attempt I tried a new image with hair that was more detactable. And this was the result:\n \n\n\nResults & Discussion\nI didn’t know what to expect, but it seems as though ChatGPT exaggerated the input I gave it. It appears to get the framing/shape of what the back of my head could look like. I also see that it continues where it would think my middle part would be like from the back. That detail is interesting. Despite this, it still gave me straightish/wavy-ish hair, not really a good match for the frontal view of my hair at all. It’s less defined and has A LOT more volume than what I gave it. I think the image it generated is flattering and pretty as well but it just doesn’t represent or complete what I look like though. It also misses other details to my hair as well. In the image that is generated, the two hair pieces in the front are in a bun-like shape, but in the image I gave it, I don’t have buns in addition to them also being composed of twists.\nI believe that it misses the detail in the style of my hair because the “pixels” that are used to train this model to recognize patterns in an image are not as defined so the model views the pieces of hair as strands instead of other things it could’ve been–like braids or dreads–from that distance. Though I am curious as to why it gave me buns, despite there having been good definition to see that that just wasn’t the style in the picture I gave it. I am also wondering why it gave me so much more volume as well.\n\n\nFinal Attempt\nI figured CHAT has struggle determining my hair texture because it’s struggling to view definition. I passed it this image next:\n\nAnd it generated this:\n\nTo be honest this might be the best attempt at generating what the heck could be happening in the back of my head. It’s the closest out of all the pictures to my hair type and what a style I did would look like from the back. But it still gets the shape off a little bit and is still a looser hair pattern than my texture.\n\n\nOverall Assessment of Chat’s Familiarity with Type 4 Hair\nFrom trying to work with ChatGPT to generate a possibility for what my hair type could look like from the back, I figure that ChatGPT has an easier time doing so, when it has a lot more clues and when it’s from a closer viewpoint. But it still has a hard time generating an image matching a kinky hair type. It will need more development to accommodate and understand patterns regarding really textured hair types."

    "text": "Routinely, it is us that is asking the questions or giving statements to LLMs/AI models. We obviously know we’re not talking to a person when we do this, it feels like we are talking to a robot, which we essentially are. Despite being an AI model made to represent humankind as best as is possible right now, there are many things that it will probably never have, like a personality. We are unique in that way, our personalities develop and change over time, but in addition, we also use our logic specifically unique to us, to reason and come to generalizations regarding people’s personalities beyond us. Knowing this, I had the question on whether these AI models could really reason about who it thinks I truly am, despite not having a personality of its own. Would this mean for this to work, that AI could understand personality or what it is?\nI seriously doubted that it could because being able to reason about people’s personalities and coordinate that with other knowledge you may or may not have on them is socially acquired. I’ve had experiences asking ChatGPT to reason with me in a previous post and found that it failed the task I asked of it to do. Or even, like when you ask it to recall or do something with an image it just generated, it won’t have the ability to be recognizing what the heck it even generated. But like, I knew that it updates its memory, but I was never really aware as to how frequently it occurs or how powerful its memory could be. It was definitely something I had no faith in due to those previous instances. I decided to see what the heck would happen if I tested to see if ChatGPT could reason about us and our personalities. I asked it questions about me, but found its response to two of my questions very interesting.\n\n\nI asked it exactly “What exactly do you have in your memory?”\n\n\n\nI remember details about your academic interests, research projects, career goals, and some personal preferences. Here’s a summary of what I have:\n\nAcademics & Research:\n\nYou’re interested in neuroscience, cognitive science, and data analysis.\n\nYou’re minoring in data science and analytics at UPenn.\n\nYou’ve worked on projects related to neuroscience communication, memory, antisocial behavior, and parenting styles.\n\nYou’re currently in a class that teaches fMRI analysis using AFNI.\n\nYou’re considering a certification to become an MRI technician in the future.\n\nCareer & Skills:\n\nYou’re an upcoming 2025 graduate seeking a job in computational data analysis, ideally in a clinical or hospital setting.\n\nYou have experience in clinical operations and research trials.\n\nYou have strong skills in R and statistical analysis, with some experience in MATLAB and Python.\n\nYou have an interview for a research assistant position at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging.\n\nProjects & Interests:\n\nYou’re working on an R project analyzing TikTok’s influence on Spotify’s top songs.\n\nYou’re considering a project analyzing trauma center quality and crime/gun violence.\n\nYou’ve worked on stereograms and color perception experiments.\n\nYou’re writing a blog for a communications course where you explore AI’s perspective on topics of interest.\n\nOther Personal Notes:\n\nYou like protective styles but also enjoy wearing your hair out.\n\nYour boyfriend is into photography.\n\nYou planned a creative 3D printer gift reveal.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademics & Research\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue & False; Only actually worked on projects regarding antisocial behavior, and within neuroscience mostly, but the other topics are things I have asked it about before\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nCareer & Skills\n\nMostly True; interested in a job in computational neuroscience\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nProjects & Interests\n\nTrue\n\nTrue; Doing this for my class on Databases\n\nFalse; But I did learn about it in Perception class last semester\n\nTrue\n\nOther Personal Notes\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\nTo be quite honest, most of the stuff on here comes from stuff I’ve asked or told it only recently, like within the past four months. Not sure what its policies on memory updating and storage are but I expected it to have more knowledge on me considering I’ve been using it since 2023 and before I was in the field of cognitive science, but it only “remembers” things in relation to me since I’ve been in cognitive science.\nIts Difference From Humans\nAs I’ve mentioned previously, we are social animals, and acquire our knowledge of reason and logic about others in a unique way. It’s something we’ve been doing since we were little. So I definitely noticed that as part of its memory it doesn’t reason or make educated inferences despite having that much knowledge on me. For example for what I am talking about, if you ask someone to give you a summary or ask them to describe a person–usually someone they are closer to, there is some type of personal reasoning included in addition to the knowledge that they have about them, which varies based on what is important to that person. But like if it were someone close to me I would expect for them to be more adjectival regarding my personality, or give information about me that’s more sprawled out across more domains or time periods-not just from school me or from the last 3 months. Like there is a hint there of a personal connection because of the way we use reason, but the way Chat does it, it feel like it writing a report.\n\n\n\nI asked it exactly “What do you know about my personality?”\n\n\n\n\nFrom our conversations, I’ve gathered a few insights about your personality:\nCurious & Analytical:\n\nYou enjoy exploring complex topics, especially in neuroscience, cognition, and data analysis.\n\nYou like thinking critically about theories and real-world applications.\n\nDetail-Oriented & Research-Driven:\n\nYou prefer working with data, conducting thorough analyses, and structuring your arguments based on evidence.\n\nYour projects, like analyzing TikTok’s influence on Spotify and studying trauma center quality, reflect a strong research mindset.\n\nCreative & Thoughtful:\n\nYou come up with unique ideas, such as the creative 3D printer gift reveal.\n\nYou also explore new ways to communicate scientific ideas, like your neuroscience podcast and AI blog project.\n\nIndependent & Goal-Oriented:\n\nYou’re proactive about your career, actively looking for research opportunities and internships while considering long-term plans like MRI certification.\n\nHands-On Learner:\n\nYou prefer learning through examples and practical applications rather than just theory.\n\nBalanced & Open-Minded:\n\nYou have a mix of scientific rigor and an appreciation for human experiences, such as your interest in parenting styles and criminal behavior in relation to free will.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurious & Analytical\n\nFalse & True; I’m not that curious tbh but definitely analytical. I’ve always enjoyed the analysis side of things\n\nDetail Oriented & Research Drive\n\nMostly True; I enjoy working with data alot, I am majoring in cognitive science and minoring in data science and analytics, both very data driven fields.\n\nCreative & Thoughtful\n\nFalse & True; I’ve never really been someone I consider being creative, I literally procrastinated on this blog because I struggled to come up with anything creative enough lol.\nBut I do consider myself thoughtful and have been described as a considerate person\n\nIndependent & Goal Oriented\n\nTrue. I grew up the first born/daughter in an immigrant household so I’ve always been a self starter and proactive because I learned from a very young age that really most of the time there isn’t going to be someone to help you.\n\nHands-On Learner\n\nVery True; For a long time I thought I was a visual learner, but I absolutely hate when someone is trying to teach me something without providing any examples or without letting me try to do what I’m learning on my own.\n\nBalanced & Open-Minded\n\nNeither; I don’t really feel like this reflects me, but I believe this comes as a result as Chat GPT trying to reason with who it thinks I am. As a Cognitive Science major, my field is very interdisciplinary, as it is literally composed of 6 differents fields masked into one. And two of them are Neurosciecnce-where I’ve learned about criminal behavior and Philosophy-where I had to reflect on free will. I’m sure GPT remembered the questions I asked it during those times I was taking those classes, and assumed that due to the range in questions academically that I’m balanced.\n\n\n\n\nConsidering that it kind of missed the mark on the first question in relation to details about who I am and my personality, I prompted it specifically about my personality. And it can for sure use the knowledge it “remembers” about me to reason about the type of person it thinks I am, but I find it interesting that within its memory, it doesn’t have these traits or this reasoning relationship as part of its memory, which I find to be different from humans. At least within my memory of a person, I will remember things like, oh this person is innovative or random or annoying–in addition to the objective things I know about them as well. That kind of reasoning goes hand in hand with memory and perception of others (and their personality)."
