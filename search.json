    "text": "Testing ChatGPT‚Äôs Familiarity with Afrocentric Features\n\nAs a person of color who has very textured hair, I found it difficult growing up finding accurate and helpful resources that would help me manage, take care of, and discover useful information regarding my hair type. However, an overwhelming majority of results that appeared represented a way looser hair texture, particularly straight hair. I struggled to easily be able to find people that looked like me in the results.\nNow in 2025, when I use the same ‚Äúeasy hairstyles to try‚Äù search, there are actually some results that include Black people and a couple that have my hair texture. Despite some progress, it still took a good amount of time to even get to this point.\n\nWithin AI, we know that models are trained to recognize patterns and to predict and complete them. With the issues I have described I was curious as to its experience with recognizing my hair type despite, my hair texture‚Äôs history with a lack of representation.\nAs someone who does their own hair, I generally question what the back of my head looks like. I usually see the front or the side of my head from time to time. So I questioned whether AI could properly determine what it thinks the back of my head looks like considering the hair texture that I have.\nI gave ChatGPT a prompt to determine this question:\n\n\n\nI gave it this image to start:\n\nThe clues I gave it are highlighted in this image:\n\nI wanted to test how ChatGPT would produce an image based on minimal clues regarding my hairstyle, to see how it would predict what the back of what my head looked like. This photo shows the top of my hairstyle, so that I could guide Chat in the right direction so it doesn‚Äôt assume I‚Äôm bald or something. It also shows some hair near my ear, so that it sees that my hair is textured and not straight.\n\n\nResults & Discussion\n \nIt actually gets the hairstyle I am truly wearing here pretty close despite not having a lot of clues, but it gets my hair texture completely off. It predicts my hair being completely straight when my hair is the complete opposite.\nSince AI is trained to recognize and complete patterns CHAT probably determined that the hair on the top of my head is extremely straight which it does appear because of how slick it is. I‚Äôve concluded that it fails to realize a slick back can be done on any hair texture, and it mistakenly ruled out the possibility that hairstyle with this characteristic can have a variety of input, not just straight hair.\n\n\nSecond Attempt\nIn this attempt I tried a new image with hair that was more detactable. And this was the result:\n \n\n\nResults & Discussion\nI didn‚Äôt know what to expect, but it seems as though ChatGPT exaggerated the input I gave it. It appears to get the framing/shape of what the back of my head could look like. I also see that it continues where it would think my middle part would be like from the back. That detail is interesting. Despite this, it still gave me straightish/wavy-ish hair, not really a good match for the frontal view of my hair at all. It‚Äôs less defined and has A LOT more volume than what I gave it. I think the image it generated is flattering and pretty as well but it just doesn‚Äôt represent or complete what I look like though. It also misses other details to my hair as well. In the image that is generated, the two hair pieces in the front are in a bun-like shape, but in the image I gave it, I don‚Äôt have buns in addition to them also being composed of twists.\nI believe that it misses the detail in the style of my hair because the ‚Äúpixels‚Äù that are used to train this model to recognize patterns in an image are not as defined so the model views the pieces of hair as strands instead of other things it could‚Äôve been‚Äìlike braids or dreads‚Äìfrom that distance. Though I am curious as to why it gave me buns, despite there having been good definition to see that that just wasn‚Äôt the style in the picture I gave it. I am also wondering why it gave me so much more volume as well.\n\n\nFinal Attempt\nI figured CHAT has struggle determining my hair texture because it‚Äôs struggling to view definition. I passed it this image next:\n\nAnd it generated this:\n\nTo be honest this might be the best attempt at generating what the heck could be happening in the back of my head. It‚Äôs the closest out of all the pictures to my hair type and what a style I did would look like from the back. But it still gets the shape off a little bit and is still a looser hair pattern than my texture.\n\n\nOverall Assessment of Chat‚Äôs Familiarity with Type 4 Hair\nFrom trying to work with ChatGPT to generate a possibility for what my hair type could look like from the back, I figure that ChatGPT has an easier time doing so, when it has a lot more clues and when it‚Äôs from a closer viewpoint. But it still has a hard time generating an image matching a kinky hair type. It will need more development to accommodate and understand patterns regarding really textured hair types."

    "text": "Routinely, it is us that is asking the questions or giving statements to LLMs/AI models. We obviously know we‚Äôre not talking to a person when we do this, it feels like we are talking to a robot, which we essentially are. Despite being an AI model made to represent humankind as best as is possible right now, there are many things that it will probably never have, like a personality. We are unique in that way, our personalities develop and change over time, but in addition, we also use our logic specifically unique to us, to reason and come to generalizations regarding people‚Äôs personalities beyond us. Knowing this, I had the question on whether these AI models could really reason about who it thinks I truly am, despite not having a personality of its own. Would this mean for this to work, that AI could understand personality or what it is?\nI seriously doubted that it could because being able to reason about people‚Äôs personalities and coordinate that with other knowledge you may or may not have on them is socially acquired. I‚Äôve had experiences asking ChatGPT to reason with me in a previous post and found that it failed the task I asked of it to do. Or even, like when you ask it to recall or do something with an image it just generated, it won‚Äôt have the ability to be recognizing what the heck it even generated. But like, I knew that it updates its memory, but I was never really aware as to how frequently it occurs or how powerful its memory could be. It was definitely something I had no faith in due to those previous instances. I decided to see what the heck would happen if I tested to see if ChatGPT could reason about us and our personalities. I asked it questions about me, but found its response to two of my questions very interesting.\n\n\nI asked it exactly ‚ÄúWhat exactly do you have in your memory?‚Äù\n\n\n\nI remember details about your academic interests, research projects, career goals, and some personal preferences. Here‚Äôs a summary of what I have:\n\nAcademics & Research:\n\nYou‚Äôre interested in neuroscience, cognitive science, and data analysis.\n\nYou‚Äôre minoring in data science and analytics at UPenn.\n\nYou‚Äôve worked on projects related to neuroscience communication, memory, antisocial behavior, and parenting styles.\n\nYou‚Äôre currently in a class that teaches fMRI analysis using AFNI.\n\nYou‚Äôre considering a certification to become an MRI technician in the future.\n\nCareer & Skills:\n\nYou‚Äôre an upcoming 2025 graduate seeking a job in computational data analysis, ideally in a clinical or hospital setting.\n\nYou have experience in clinical operations and research trials.\n\nYou have strong skills in R and statistical analysis, with some experience in MATLAB and Python.\n\nYou have an interview for a research assistant position at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging.\n\nProjects & Interests:\n\nYou‚Äôre working on an R project analyzing TikTok‚Äôs influence on Spotify‚Äôs top songs.\n\nYou‚Äôre considering a project analyzing trauma center quality and crime/gun violence.\n\nYou‚Äôve worked on stereograms and color perception experiments.\n\nYou‚Äôre writing a blog for a communications course where you explore AI‚Äôs perspective on topics of interest.\n\nOther Personal Notes:\n\nYou like protective styles but also enjoy wearing your hair out.\n\nYour boyfriend is into photography.\n\nYou planned a creative 3D printer gift reveal.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademics & Research\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue & False; Only actually worked on projects regarding antisocial behavior, and within neuroscience mostly, but the other topics are things I have asked it about before\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nCareer & Skills\n\nMostly True; interested in a job in computational neuroscience\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nProjects & Interests\n\nTrue\n\nTrue; Doing this for my class on Databases\n\nFalse; But I did learn about it in Perception class last semester\n\nTrue\n\nOther Personal Notes\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\nTo be quite honest, most of the stuff on here comes from stuff I‚Äôve asked or told it only recently, like within the past four months. Not sure what its policies on memory updating and storage are but I expected it to have more knowledge on me considering I‚Äôve been using it since 2023 and before I was in the field of cognitive science, but it only ‚Äúremembers‚Äù things in relation to me since I‚Äôve been in cognitive science.\nIts Difference From Humans\nAs I‚Äôve mentioned previously, we are social animals, and acquire our knowledge of reason and logic about others in a unique way. It‚Äôs something we‚Äôve been doing since we were little. So I definitely noticed that as part of its memory it doesn‚Äôt reason or make educated inferences despite having that much knowledge on me. For example for what I am talking about, if you ask someone to give you a summary or ask them to describe a person‚Äìusually someone they are closer to, there is some type of personal reasoning included in addition to the knowledge that they have about them, which varies based on what is important to that person. But like if it were someone close to me I would expect for them to be more adjectival regarding my personality, or give information about me that‚Äôs more sprawled out across more domains or time periods-not just from school me or from the last 3 months. Like there is a hint there of a personal connection because of the way we use reason, but the way Chat does it, it feel like it writing a report.\n\n\n\nI asked it exactly ‚ÄúWhat do you know about my personality?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nFrom our conversations, I‚Äôve gathered a few insights about your personality:\nCurious & Analytical:\n\nYou enjoy exploring complex topics, especially in neuroscience, cognition, and data analysis.\n\nYou like thinking critically about theories and real-world applications.\n\nDetail-Oriented & Research-Driven:\n\nYou prefer working with data, conducting thorough analyses, and structuring your arguments based on evidence.\n\nYour projects, like analyzing TikTok‚Äôs influence on Spotify and studying trauma center quality, reflect a strong research mindset.\n\nCreative & Thoughtful:\n\nYou come up with unique ideas, such as the creative 3D printer gift reveal.\n\nYou also explore new ways to communicate scientific ideas, like your neuroscience podcast and AI blog project.\n\nIndependent & Goal-Oriented:\n\nYou‚Äôre proactive about your career, actively looking for research opportunities and internships while considering long-term plans like MRI certification.\n\nHands-On Learner:\n\nYou prefer learning through examples and practical applications rather than just theory.\n\nBalanced & Open-Minded:\n\nYou have a mix of scientific rigor and an appreciation for human experiences, such as your interest in parenting styles and criminal behavior in relation to free will.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurious & Analytical\n\nFalse & True; I‚Äôm not that curious tbh but definitely analytical. I‚Äôve always enjoyed the analysis side of things\n\nDetail Oriented & Research Drive\n\nMostly True; I enjoy working with data alot, I am majoring in cognitive science and minoring in data science and analytics, both very data driven fields.\n\nCreative & Thoughtful\n\nFalse & True; I‚Äôve never really been someone I consider being creative, I literally procrastinated on this blog because I struggled to come up with anything creative enough lol.\nBut I do consider myself thoughtful and have been described as a considerate person\n\nIndependent & Goal Oriented\n\nTrue. I grew up the first born/daughter in an immigrant household so I‚Äôve always been a self starter and proactive because I learned from a very young age that really most of the time there isn‚Äôt going to be someone to help you.\n\nHands-On Learner\n\nVery True; For a long time I thought I was a visual learner, but I absolutely hate when someone is trying to teach me something without providing any examples or without letting me try to do what I‚Äôm learning on my own.\n\nBalanced & Open-Minded\n\nNeither; I don‚Äôt really feel like this reflects me, but I believe this comes as a result as Chat GPT trying to reason with who it thinks I am. As a Cognitive Science major, my field is very interdisciplinary, as it is literally composed of 6 differents fields masked into one. And two of them are Neurosciecnce-where I‚Äôve learned about criminal behavior and Philosophy-where I had to reflect on free will. I‚Äôm sure GPT remembered the questions I asked it during those times I was taking those classes, and assumed that due to the range in questions academically that I‚Äôm balanced.\n\n\n\n\nConsidering that it kind of missed the mark on the first question in relation to details about who I am and my personality, I prompted it specifically about my personality. And it can for sure use the knowledge it ‚Äúremembers‚Äù about me to reason about the type of person it thinks I am, but I find it interesting that within its memory, it doesn‚Äôt have these traits or this reasoning relationship as part of its memory, which I find to be different from humans. At least within my memory of a person, I will remember things like, oh this person is innovative or random or annoying‚Äìin addition to the objective things I know about them as well. That kind of reasoning goes hand in hand with memory and perception of others (and their personality)."

    "text": "Curious & Analytical\n\nFalse & True; I‚Äôm not that curious tbh but definitely analytical. I‚Äôve always enjoyed the analysis side of things\n\nDetail Oriented & Research Drive\n\nMostly True; I enjoy working with data alot, I am majoring in cognitive science and minoring in data science and analytics, both very data driven fields.\n\nCreative & Thoughtful\n\nFalse & True; I‚Äôve never really been someone I consider being creative, I literally procrastinated on this blog because I struggled to come up with anything creative enough lol.\nBut I do consider myself thoughtful and have been described as a considerate person\n\nIndependent & Goal Oriented\n\nTrue. I grew up the first born/daughter in an immigrant household so I‚Äôve always been a self starter and proactive because I learned from a very young age that really most of the time there isn‚Äôt going to be someone to help you.\n\nHands-On Learner\n\nVery True; For a long time I thought I was a visual learner, but I absolutely hate when someone is trying to teach me something without providing any examples or without letting me try to do what I‚Äôm learning on my own.\n\nBalanced & Open-Minded\n\nNeither; I don‚Äôt really feel like this reflects me, but I believe this comes as a result as Chat GPT trying to reason with who it thinks I am. As a Cognitive Science major, my field is very interdisciplinary, as it is literally composed of 6 differents fields masked into one. And two of them are Neurosciecnce-where I‚Äôve learned about criminal behavior and Philosophy-where I had to reflect on free will. I‚Äôm sure GPT remembered the questions I asked it during those times I was taking those classes, and assumed that due to the range in questions academically that I‚Äôm balanced."

And it can for sure use the knowledge it ‚Äúremembers‚Äù about me to reason about the type of person it thinks I am, but I find it interesting that within its memory, it doesn‚Äôt have these traits or this reasoning relationship as part of its memory, which I find to be different from humans. At least within my memory of a person, I will remember things like, oh this person is innovative or random or annoying‚Äìin addition to the objective things I know about them as well. That kind of reasoning goes hand in hand with memory and perception of others (and their personality)."

    "text": "Can ChatGPT Logic Like We Do?\nI asked ChatGPT to play Hangman with me to see if it can guess the word after very obvious priming prior\n\nIn class we discussed how Chat GPT models are always playing some type of guessing game where they are trying to predict what we are going to say or do next.\nAs a cog sci major, I have taken other courses where I have also learned about language prediction models, where words are each weighted with their own probabilities that represent how often they occur in the language, especially particularly after a previous word\nRecently I was curious in understanding if Chat GPT could really predict our langauge the way humans would predict language but in process that requires greater logic. The process I used is as follows:\n\nI asked for ChatGPT to generate an 8 letter word that would be used for us to play Hangman.\n\n\n\nI passed the following prompt to invite Chat to play Hangman\n\n\n\nI continue to play the game until Chat runs out of tries\nReveal whether it guesses the word correctly or not\n\nI found that as I kept playing with Chat, it kept guessing for the word despite literally giving me a word before we had played the game. It ultimately never guessed the word properly within the allotted 6 tries.\n\nIn fact, even when I tell it the word, it acts and appears as if it never gave me the word in the first place.\nWhen it comes to humans, if I had asked them to give me a word first and then made them be the ones to guess the word out of a sudden game of hangman, they would immediately suspect that the word they are trying to find is the one they literally just gave me. Even if they don‚Äôt immediately guess the word on the first try, I would expect them to guess the correct letters immediately to ensure that the word they‚Äôre guessing is the one they gave.\nThis is just how our logic is, and an AI model is not able to replicate this kind of common sense."
