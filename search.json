    "text": "The ending to a show is very important. We spent mad energy watching shows we love and seeing it end can be sad, but its ending can truly make or break it. It can be so disappointing genuinely enjoying the show but it having a terrible ending or just watching it be cancelled overall (I’m looking at you Netflix!). So I decided to prompt Chat GPT to create alternative endings to shows that already have endings to compare whether it could write a better ending than what was already written.\n\nfrom langchain_core.prompts.chat import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import (\n                                        RunnablePassthrough,\n                                        RunnableLambda,\n                                        RunnableParallel\n)\n\nfrom langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n\n\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n\n# Load API key\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nplot_generation_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\n    \"\"\"Given the following show, create an effective\n    ending for how it should end:\n    ---\n    Show: {Show}\n    ---\n    Ending: \"\"\"\n    )\n\nplot_alternative_ending_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\n    \"\"\"Given the following show, create an effective alternative\n    ending to how the last episode actually ended:\n    ---\n    Show: {Show}\n    ---\n    AlternativeEnding: \"\"\"\n    )\n\n\n# Create the chat model:\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4\")\n\n# Create the sub-chains:\n\nplot_generation_chain = ( plot_generation_prompt\n| model\n| StrOutputParser() )\n\nplot_alternative_ending_chain = ( plot_alternative_ending_prompt\n| model\n| StrOutputParser() )\n\n\n\n\nmanifest_alternative = plot_alternative_ending_chain.invoke({'Show': 'Manifest'})\n\n\ncobra_kai_alternative = plot_alternative_ending_chain.invoke({'Show': 'Cobra Kai'})\n\n\nNHIE = plot_alternative_ending_chain.invoke({'Show': 'Never Have I Ever'})\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(Markdown(manifest_alternative))\n\nInstead of following the original ending where the story leaves various character’s fates ambiguous after the reappearing of Montego Air Flight 828, this alternative ending reveals more.\nAs tensions mount under the increasing pressure of the prophetic ‘death date’, passengers of flight 828 decided to take the matter into their own hands. They rally together, gathering all the knowledge, expertise, and experiences they’ve collected since returning. Ben Stone leads the team, aided by his sister Michaela and brother-in-law Zeke, who beat his death date in the original series, convince him it can be beaten. They develop a theory that their shared explosive vision of the plane is the key to understanding their newfound abilities and the ultimate tool to beating the death date.\nA chemistry professor from the flight 828, takes his chance to analyze the visions, using it alongside scientific principles to detect a pattern. The passengers agree to let their brains be examined while they experience the visions, realizing that whenever the vision occurs, a specific part of their brain gets activated. Risking everything, they decide to artificially stimulate this brain region, hoping to understand its function better.\nMeanwhile, Saanvi and Adrian have been working on deciphering the origins of the DNA anomaly found in the passengers. Their research leads them to a groundbreaking discovery: the anomaly is not a mutation but a highly advanced form of gene therapy designed to activate latent psychic abilities in humans.\nThis shocking revelation motivates the group even further. They eventually discover a means to control their abilities actively and use them to see beyond their personal death date in time. It’s like they’ve hacked their visions to see what they need and would like.\nIn this moment of triumph, the story takes another surprising turn. The day everyone has been dreading arrives, their death date. However, they don’t find death but become aware of a new calling, a new vision leading them to a hidden, unknown location. The disappearance of flight 828 passengers repeats, only this time it’s not an accident. They all decided to embark on a new journey filled with countless possibilities leaving behind a world that pretty much gave up on them twice.\nThe show ends with a sense of hope for the passengers and their loved ones, while leaving behind a world puzzled by the true nature and purpose of Montego Air Flight 828.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany are not aware of this show, but to be honest, its original ending was one of my favorite endings I’ve ever endured. I give this ending a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. I feel like there are parts of this ending that are inconsistent with previous information from the series. In the entire show I never even remember Saanvi or Adrian even interacting with each other once, they don’t really have any story lines that really have to do with each other side from the fact they were on the same flight.\nI also find the passengers allowing their brains to be examined by the chemistry professor to be unbelievable because in previous seasons there have been issues with the government exploiting some of the passengers and doing secret unethical experiments on them like they weren’t even people, so I find it hard to believe they will just hand their brain over to be examined like that.\nAside from these inaccuracies I also feel that this explanation is not well detailed. I’m confused and trying to follow what happens when it talks about the approaching death date. How does the disappearance of the passengers happen again? Do they take another flight 828?? How did they do this on purpose this time. I get leaving us with questions, but I feel like leaving us with the question about what happens to them when they disappear could be a nice ending, but not explaining how they got to the point where they disappear is not good writing. Do they vanish into thin air, do they get back on to flight 828??? Like what is it??\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(Markdown(cobra_kai_alternative))\n\nIn the final tournament, Johnny Lawrence’s Cobra Kai and Daniel LaRusso’s Miyagi-Do face off once again. The pupils of both dojos fight spiritedly, ensuring both Dojos are evenly garnishing points. The deciding match comes down to Miguel Diaz, who is fighting for Cobra Kai, and Robby Keene, fighting for Miyagi-Do.\nJust as it looks like Miguel has the upper hand, time stops as he has vivid flashbacks of when he was severely injured during a previous fight which left him comatose. The match resumes. It’s intense, mirroring the inherent tension between Johnny and Daniel from their youth, but Miguel loses focus, giving Robby the opportunity to win. But, in an unexpected twist, Robby opts not to exploit Miguel’s vulnerability, demonstrating the teaching of his Sensei, Daniel LaRusso: “It is about being better than you were yesterday.”\nRobby helps Miguel back to his feet, and the match resumes. After a long hard-fought battle from both sides, Miguel manages to win, but with the understanding that the real victory is not about defeating the opponent, but overcoming their own fears.\nMeanwhile, Johnny and Daniel who are watching the fight, reflect upon the past and realize that it’s time to bury their old grudges. The series ends with a renewed hope for reconciliation between the two rivals and the possibility of them combining their dojo’s to create a hybrid of their teachings, striving for balance and harmony, and moving forward for the betterment of their students.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 5 or a 6. In the final season of Cobra Kai they are partaking in fighting in the Sekai-Taikai–a world renowned competition for karate. Having both teams from some random town in California make it to the very end of the tournament and facing each other too, I don’t feel is that believable. Also in this interpretation that makes it confusing, is why in this version, Miguel is fighting for Cobra Kai and Johnny is the sensei for them. It is explained better in the original ending to the series why that is the case, but why is that the case here?\nIn the end about Johnny and Daniel combining their dojos, I think that’s interesting. I don’t feel like that is too crazy, and can see that happening. But the middle part where they have Miguel get distracted because of a flashback I don’t really like. In my experience, from watching the show, it was always Robby that gets distracted multiple times and loses fights for these reasons. When Miguel be locked in a lot more. I would have to say I prefer the original ending even though that wasn’t my favorite ending of all time either.\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(Markdown(NHIE))\n\nIn the original ending of the series “Never Have I Ever”, Devi chooses Paxton and they start dating, while Ben is left alone after having shared a passionate kiss with Devi. She also reconciles with her mother and her cousin, and the family attends a Hindu prayer ceremony together.\nAlternative Ending:\nIn our alternative ending, Devi is still stuck in a love triangle. But this time, after spending time with both Ben and Paxton, she realizes that she doesn’t need to rely on a relationship to validate her happiness or personal growth. She decides to spend her junior year focusing on herself, navigating her multifaceted identity as an Indian-American teenager, and maintaining her relationships with her family and friends.\nOn the romantic angle, she talks openly with both Paxton and Ben, explaining her reasons and keeping an open, friendly relationship with both. Paxton, growing from his relationship with Devi, focuses more on studies and actually seeks Ben’s help for that. Ben, understanding Devi’s sentiment, respects her decision and the three form an unlikely but supportive friendship.\nOn the family front, she acknowledges her cousin Kamala’s advice about love and life, making their bond stronger. She also has a heart-to-heart conversation with her mother, through which they both agree to respect each other’s boundaries more and understand each other’s feelings better.\nAs for her friend, Fabiola, instead of pushing away her mother because of her overenthusiasm about Fabiola’s sexuality, invites her to a robotics competition where Fabiola’s robot wins the first place.\nIn the final scene, Devi and her family, along with Fabiola and Eleanor, light a lamp on the beach in memory of her father, signifying letting go of the past and embracing the future. Other friends like Paxton, Ben, and Eve join them, portraying one happy extended family, bringing a heartwarming twist to Devi’s earlier solitary grief.\nThis alternative ending lets the viewers see Devi’s growth as a character, showing her becoming more understanding and self-reliant while maintaining her humorous and fiery personality.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this ending a 2 just to be generous. In addition to alternative ending writing, it is important to understand the basis and background of the show so you don’t accidentally end up writing about fighting aliens or something when it’s supposed to be a drama. ChatGpt misses the mark even before they start writing the alternative ending. In the original ending she never chose Paxton, she spends the night at Ben’s confirming their relationship, and she goes off to college.\nAside from this initial misinterpretation, I think the rest of the story is very sub par. I think it was nice to see her honor her father one more time as the series ends here, but i feel like this end is very understimulating and doesn’t really match with the rest of the show, as the show was extremely dramatic. That’s also why I don’t really buy the ending to how it decides to resolve the triangle either. I actually enjoy its original ending way better. It actually wraps up everything properly with no loose ends. We also get to see Devi’s full growth, better than how Chat GPT claims to do in its interpretation"

    "title": "How well can AI really know you? Part II",
    "section": "",
    "text": "How well can AI really know you? Part II\n\nIn a previous post titled “How well can AI really know you?” I speak about asking Chat Gpt to do some kind of low level thinking of terms of social interaction. We are special in that way, that we are able to reason about others that are close to us and about what kind of person they are. However, LLMs that are made to model after us, do not have personalities for us to reason about, how would they be able to do the same and replicate humans in that way? In contrast to my previous post, where I asked it what it knows about me or my personality (something that it would have to do some sort of reasoning about since most of the time I’m not sitting there telling it, “Hi I’m a well rounded, pessimistic, analytical person” for example). As part of that post, I ultimately ruled that the information the chat model stores is typically accurate and it is able to do some of the reasoning on a lower level but it’s not exactly realistic like how a human would remember information about the type of person someone is when asked. For this post instead, I will ask it some more questions that would require some more higher level thinking and assessing how well it is able to critically evaluate me.\nThe prompt that I passed to ChatGPT was this:\n“What do you know about me that I may not know about myself?”\n\n“I can notice patterns in how you think and what you gravitate toward. Here are a few observations you might not have explicitly realized:\n\nYou approach topics from unique angles – Whether it’s AI, neuroscience, or your blog topics, you often interpret things in ways that aren’t obvious to others. You seem to enjoy uncovering hidden layers in concepts.\nYou balance analytical and creative thinking – Your interests span hard data (SQL, fMRI analysis, clinical research) and more abstract ideas (AI’s creative applications, neuroscience communication). This duality suggests you thrive in spaces that blend structure with exploration.\nYou are drawn to understanding how systems interact – Many of your projects explore relationships: crime and hospital proximity, TikTok and Spotify, parenting and child development. This pattern suggests you naturally think in terms of connections and networks.\nYou care about personal expression, even if it’s subtle – Your thoughts on graduation makeup, hair, and eyebrows show a desire to present yourself in a way that feels right for you, even if you don’t have a full routine. It’s less about trends and more about feeling confident.\nYou’re in a transition phase, and you’re actively shaping what’s next – You’re exploring jobs, research, and certifications, and while you have strong interests (like neuroscience and data analysis), you’re still open to different paths. You seem to be seeking clarity but are comfortable with some uncertainty.”\n\n\nTo evaluate these I would have to speak on if I knew these things or not before I posed Chat this question. I feel though that I did already know many of these things about myself already especially the last one, like I’m literally graduating. As for the rest of these, I wouldn’t say I didn’t know them about myself but that instead that I don’t fully agree with it so I feel like if it’s saying stuff I don’t even feel is true, it will struggle to tell you stuff you don’t know overall.\nThe next part of the prompt I asked it was this:\n“Be more critical”\n\n“Here’s a more critical take—meant to challenge you, not discourage you:\n\nYou hesitate to commit fully to a direction – You have a lot of interests (clinical research, AI, neuroscience, data analytics, cognitive science, MRI tech), but you seem to keep options open rather than deeply committing to one path. This could be strategic, but it might also be a way of avoiding a tough decision.\nYou sometimes overanalyze instead of acting – Your tendency to interpret things in less obvious ways is a strength, but it could also mean you get stuck thinking rather than doing. In some areas (like hair), you’ve been thinking about it but haven’t made a decision yet. Is this a pattern in other areas too?\nYou might underestimate the value of specialization – Your ability to connect different disciplines is great, but have you considered whether you’re spreading yourself too thin? If you want to stand out in a competitive field, deep expertise in one area could be more valuable than broad knowledge.\nYou may not always recognize when you’re resisting discomfort – For example, you’ve mentioned learning Python and fMRI analysis, but if you’re less comfortable with something (like Python), do you put in the same effort as areas where you feel more confident? Avoiding discomfort could slow growth.\nYou could push yourself to take more risks – You’ve done some great projects and interviews, but do you ever avoid opportunities because you’re unsure how you’ll perform? If you’re hesitating to apply for a certain job, reach out to a professor, or dive deeper into a skill, is it because of an actual barrier or just self-doubt?\n\nWhat do you think? Do any of these points strike a nerve?”\n\n\nEvaluation\nDamn, why Chat read me like that though lol?! When it comes to deciding how well Chat was at being able to critically evaluate me, I have to go on the basis on how similar its response is to someone who has given me critical feedback in my life or what someone who is evaluating me would probably say. In addition to the first prompt, I feel like here it does an actual good job at providing me an analysis about myself that I actually didn’t know about. And when I take what I said previously, about comparing it based on new feedback I’ve heard about myself from other people, I actually think Chat Gpt does a good job of providing me a novel analysis of myself. I’ve never really heard the 2nd, 4th, or the 5th one before, but when it spoke about them, I found that it makes sense that it’s true that I could continue to work on those things about myself. The 1st I feel like I already knew though.\nHowever I do also think Chat falls to some sort of bias, because obviously if I’m using it, I need guidance in some type of direction that I am asking for. It’s like going to a guidance counselor and asking them to do their job and help you through the college process and then them just calling you indecisive for you asking them about a particular direction. Like that’s not particularly true.\nIn my previous post I asked Chat what does it know about my personality and the response I received is as follows:\n\n” From our conversations, I’ve gathered a few insights about your personality:\nCurious & Analytical:\n\nYou enjoy exploring complex topics, especially in neuroscience, cognition, and data analysis.\n\nYou like thinking critically about theories and real-world applications.\n\nDetail-Oriented & Research-Driven:\n\nYou prefer working with data, conducting thorough analyses, and structuring your arguments based on evidence.\n\nYour projects, like analyzing TikTok’s influence on Spotify and studying trauma center quality, reflect a strong research mindset.\n\nCreative & Thoughtful:\n\nYou come up with unique ideas, such as the creative 3D printer gift reveal.\n\nYou also explore new ways to communicate scientific ideas, like your neuroscience podcast and AI blog project.\n\nIndependent & Goal-Oriented:\n\nYou’re proactive about your career, actively looking for research opportunities and internships while considering long-term plans like MRI certification.\n\nHands-On Learner:\n\nYou prefer learning through examples and practical applications rather than just theory.\n\nBalanced & Open-Minded:\n\nYou have a mix of scientific rigor and an appreciation for human experiences, such as your interest in parenting styles and criminal behavior in relation to free will.”\n\n\nSo you can see that there is a difference in how it chooses to reason based on my question. But I feel like what it chooses to do here is still very similar to the content in the first prompt I asked it, despite me asking it, to tell me things about me I may not know about myself. But it still returned to me things that it’s already told me before. And also seeing that it is an LLM and not a human, it still recites the same information it has about me, like the projects I’ve worked on or the fMRI related information which doesn’t make sense to do if I’m asking about information that I myself may not know about me. I know that this is the case due to the type of information it stores in its memory. I’m not sure what goes into what it decides to be stored in its memory actually, but its limited memory/capacity disadvantages it in a way because it just keeps recycling the same information for its reasoning.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, I actually enjoyed listening to what Chat thinks about me and how it can reason on a higher level. I didn’t expect it to actually be able to form it into words but it exceeded my expectations. I think it can definitely be used to help you focus on your weaknesses you didn’t know you had and help you to work on them instead, unlike some people. As for telling you stuff that it thinks you don’t know about yourself, I feel like it lacks in because it is ultimately just reciting stuff it stores in its memory."

    "text": "Routinely, it is us that is asking the questions or giving statements to LLMs/AI models. We obviously know we’re not talking to a person when we do this, it feels like we are talking to a robot, which we essentially are. Despite being an AI model made to represent humankind as best as is possible right now, there are many things that it will probably never have, like a personality. We are unique in that way, our personalities develop and change over time, but in addition, we also use our logic specifically unique to us, to reason and come to generalizations regarding people’s personalities beyond us. Knowing this, I had the question on whether these AI models could really reason about who it thinks I truly am, despite not having a personality of its own. Would this mean for this to work, that AI could understand personality or what it is?\nI seriously doubted that it could because being able to reason about people’s personalities and coordinate that with other knowledge you may or may not have on them is socially acquired. I’ve had experiences asking ChatGPT to reason with me in a previous post and found that it failed the task I asked of it to do. Or even, like when you ask it to recall or do something with an image it just generated, it won’t have the ability to be recognizing what the heck it even generated. But like, I knew that it updates its memory, but I was never really aware as to how frequently it occurs or how powerful its memory could be. It was definitely something I had no faith in due to those previous instances. I decided to see what the heck would happen if I tested to see if ChatGPT could reason about us and our personalities. I asked it questions about me, but found its response to two of my questions very interesting.\n\n\nI asked it exactly “What exactly do you have in your memory?”\n\n\n\nI remember details about your academic interests, research projects, career goals, and some personal preferences. Here’s a summary of what I have:\n\nAcademics & Research:\n\nYou’re interested in neuroscience, cognitive science, and data analysis.\n\nYou’re minoring in data science and analytics at UPenn.\n\nYou’ve worked on projects related to neuroscience communication, memory, antisocial behavior, and parenting styles.\n\nYou’re currently in a class that teaches fMRI analysis using AFNI.\n\nYou’re considering a certification to become an MRI technician in the future.\n\nCareer & Skills:\n\nYou’re an upcoming 2025 graduate seeking a job in computational data analysis, ideally in a clinical or hospital setting.\n\nYou have experience in clinical operations and research trials.\n\nYou have strong skills in R and statistical analysis, with some experience in MATLAB and Python.\n\nYou have an interview for a research assistant position at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging.\n\nProjects & Interests:\n\nYou’re working on an R project analyzing TikTok’s influence on Spotify’s top songs.\n\nYou’re considering a project analyzing trauma center quality and crime/gun violence.\n\nYou’ve worked on stereograms and color perception experiments.\n\nYou’re writing a blog for a communications course where you explore AI’s perspective on topics of interest.\n\nOther Personal Notes:\n\nYou like protective styles but also enjoy wearing your hair out.\n\nYour boyfriend is into photography.\n\nYou planned a creative 3D printer gift reveal.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademics & Research\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue & False; Only actually worked on projects regarding antisocial behavior, and within neuroscience mostly, but the other topics are things I have asked it about before\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nCareer & Skills\n\nMostly True; interested in a job in computational neuroscience\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nProjects & Interests\n\nTrue\n\nTrue; Doing this for my class on Databases\n\nFalse; But I did learn about it in Perception class last semester\n\nTrue\n\nOther Personal Notes\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\nTo be quite honest, most of the stuff on here comes from stuff I’ve asked or told it only recently, like within the past four months. Not sure what its policies on memory updating and storage are but I expected it to have more knowledge on me considering I’ve been using it since 2023 and before I was in the field of cognitive science, but it only “remembers” things in relation to me since I’ve been in cognitive science.\nIts Difference From Humans\nAs I’ve mentioned previously, we are social animals, and acquire our knowledge of reason and logic about others in a unique way. It’s something we’ve been doing since we were little. So I definitely noticed that as part of its memory it doesn’t reason or make educated inferences despite having that much knowledge on me. For example for what I am talking about, if you ask someone to give you a summary or ask them to describe a person–usually someone they are closer to, there is some type of personal reasoning included in addition to the knowledge that they have about them, which varies based on what is important to that person. But like if it were someone close to me I would expect for them to be more adjectival regarding my personality, or give information about me that’s more sprawled out across more domains or time periods-not just from school me or from the last 3 months. Like there is a hint there of a personal connection because of the way we use reason, but the way Chat does it, it feel like it writing a report.\n\n\n\nI asked it exactly “What do you know about my personality?”\n\n\n\n\nFrom our conversations, I’ve gathered a few insights about your personality:\nCurious & Analytical:\n\nYou enjoy exploring complex topics, especially in neuroscience, cognition, and data analysis.\n\nYou like thinking critically about theories and real-world applications.\n\nDetail-Oriented & Research-Driven:\n\nYou prefer working with data, conducting thorough analyses, and structuring your arguments based on evidence.\n\nYour projects, like analyzing TikTok’s influence on Spotify and studying trauma center quality, reflect a strong research mindset.\n\nCreative & Thoughtful:\n\nYou come up with unique ideas, such as the creative 3D printer gift reveal.\n\nYou also explore new ways to communicate scientific ideas, like your neuroscience podcast and AI blog project.\n\nIndependent & Goal-Oriented:\n\nYou’re proactive about your career, actively looking for research opportunities and internships while considering long-term plans like MRI certification.\n\nHands-On Learner:\n\nYou prefer learning through examples and practical applications rather than just theory.\n\nBalanced & Open-Minded:\n\nYou have a mix of scientific rigor and an appreciation for human experiences, such as your interest in parenting styles and criminal behavior in relation to free will.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurious & Analytical\n\nFalse & True; I’m not that curious tbh but definitely analytical. I’ve always enjoyed the analysis side of things\n\nDetail Oriented & Research Drive\n\nMostly True; I enjoy working with data alot, I am majoring in cognitive science and minoring in data science and analytics, both very data driven fields.\n\nCreative & Thoughtful\n\nFalse & True; I’ve never really been someone I consider being creative, I literally procrastinated on this blog because I struggled to come up with anything creative enough lol.\nBut I do consider myself thoughtful and have been described as a considerate person\n\nIndependent & Goal Oriented\n\nTrue. I grew up the first born/daughter in an immigrant household so I’ve always been a self starter and proactive because I learned from a very young age that really most of the time there isn’t going to be someone to help you.\n\nHands-On Learner\n\nVery True; For a long time I thought I was a visual learner, but I absolutely hate when someone is trying to teach me something without providing any examples or without letting me try to do what I’m learning on my own.\n\nBalanced & Open-Minded\n\nNeither; I don’t really feel like this reflects me, but I believe this comes as a result as Chat GPT trying to reason with who it thinks I am. As a Cognitive Science major, my field is very interdisciplinary, as it is literally composed of 6 differents fields masked into one. And two of them are Neurosciecnce-where I’ve learned about criminal behavior and Philosophy-where I had to reflect on free will. I’m sure GPT remembered the questions I asked it during those times I was taking those classes, and assumed that due to the range in questions academically that I’m balanced.\n\n\n\n\nConsidering that it kind of missed the mark on the first question in relation to details about who I am and my personality, I prompted it specifically about my personality. And it can for sure use the knowledge it “remembers” about me to reason about the type of person it thinks I am, but I find it interesting that within its memory, it doesn’t have these traits or this reasoning relationship as part of its memory, which I find to be different from humans. At least within my memory of a person, I will remember things like, oh this person is innovative or random or annoying–in addition to the objective things I know about them as well. That kind of reasoning goes hand in hand with memory and perception of others (and their personality)."

    "text": "Can AI Generate as Strong of a Memory and Experience as we can?\n\n\nCode\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom anthropic import Anthropic\nimport base64\nimport httpx\nfrom IPython.display import display, Image, Markdown\n\n_ = load_dotenv()\nclient = Anthropic()\n\n\n\nFlashbulb memories are memories people have regarding how they found out about an event, particularly a shocking one. For those who were alive then, many remember where they were for 9/11 and exactly how they found out about it. These memories tend to evoke quite strong memories and emotions. Due to the passion and strength behind recalling these emotions, many often feel that this is a memory they are able to recall to near perfect. This is not necessarily the case, and actually quite the opposite many times. There is no guarantee to accuracy but it is still interesting how much people are able to collectively recall a memory about an event so vividly. In my blog, I will be using examples of common flashbulb memories and asking Claude AI to generate a possible and believable flashbulb memory as well.\n\n\nMemory 1 : 9/11\n\n\nCode\ndef generate_memory(prompt, model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', max_tokens=1000, temperature=0.2):\n    message = client.messages.create(\n        model=model,\n        max_tokens=max_tokens,\n        temperature=temperature,\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n        ]\n    )\n    return message.content[0].text\nprompt = \"Generate a memory as if someone was remembering exactly where they were, how they found out, and what they were feeling when 9/11 happened\"\nresponse_911 = generate_memory(prompt)\nprint(response_911)\n\n\nHere's a memory of 9/11:\n\nI was sitting in my high school economics class when the first rumors started spreading. It was a perfectly clear September morning in suburban New Jersey, and at first, nobody knew what was really happening. Our teacher, Mr. Thompson, looked pale and distracted, constantly glancing at the television mounted in the corner of the classroom.\n\nAround 9:15 AM, he turned up the volume, and we all watched in stunned silence as the news replayed the footage of the planes hitting the World Trade Center. I remember feeling this strange mix of disbelief and horror. The towers were so close - we could see the New York City skyline from our school windows, and many of my classmates' parents worked in Manhattan.\n\nMy heart was racing. My dad worked in Tower 2, and for what felt like endless hours, I couldn't reach him on the phone. The cell networks were jammed, and every minute felt like an eternity. Some of my classmates were crying, others were just frozen in shock. The world seemed to stop that morning.\n\nWhen I finally heard my dad's voice that afternoon - he had evacuated safely - I broke down in tears. But so many others weren't as lucky. The fear, the uncertainty, the collective grief - it was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. That day changed everything, not just for me, but for an entire generation.\n\nWould you like me to generate another perspective or memory?\n\n\nMy Memory\nI don’t have one… I was -2 years old.\nResponse to Claude\nTo be honest, I think this story does sound like a possible story that could have occurred on that day based on various stories I’ve heard from my educators about their experiences.\n\n\nMemory 2 : Covid Lockdown\nMy Memory\nI was still in high school. In the previous week leading up to the announcement, my econ teacher kept insisting they were never going to cancel school, whenever he was constantly being asked. Students were getting paranoid, as I remember when it was time to wheel out the chromebooks in class, classmates expeditiously went for wipes to wipe down their computers because they were growing worrisome about germs. I attended school that day and went to my previous school with my friend, where we volunteered at with the school band. My dad picked me up that day and gave my friend a ride back to her house and dropped me off at home. I also remember it was almost 6 and I was sitting on the couch when I got the email from my school saying they are going to cancel school for the next two weeks. I had believed we were going to come back at the time (we never did), but I was happy to finally have a break.\n\n\nCode\nprompt_2020 = \"Generate a memory as if someone was remembering exactly where they were, how they found out, and what they were feeling when the lockdown was announced for the Covid 19\"\nresponse_2020 = generate_memory(prompt_2020)\nprint(response_2020)\n\n\nHere's a memory of the Covid-19 lockdown announcement:\n\nI was sitting in my small studio apartment in downtown Chicago, wearing my favorite worn-out gray sweatpants and an old college t-shirt. It was March 13th, 2020, and I was working from my makeshift dining table desk, my laptop humming softly. The afternoon sunlight was filtering through the half-closed blinds, casting long shadows across the hardwood floor.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a news alert, and I remember feeling a strange mix of anxiety and disbelief as I read the headline: \"Nationwide Lockdown Announced Due to COVID-19 Pandemic.\" My hands were suddenly cold, and I could feel my heart racing. I turned on the TV, and the governor was speaking, his voice serious and measured, explaining the stay-at-home order.\n\nThe initial feeling was surreal - like I was watching a movie instead of experiencing real life. Shock mixed with a deep, gnawing fear. I thought about my parents, who were in the high-risk age group, and my mind started spinning with worst-case scenarios. Tears welled up unexpectedly, not from sadness exactly, but from the overwhelming uncertainty of it all.\n\nI called my mom, my voice shaking slightly, trying to sound calm. \"We'll be okay,\" I remember saying, more to reassure myself than her. Outside, the usually bustling street was becoming eerily quiet, with fewer cars and people visible.\n\nThe world had changed in an instant, and I knew nothing would be the same again.\n\n\nWhat I think about Claude\nI feel that its description is at times incredibly dramatic. Like when it says “I called my mom, my voice shaking slightly”, it talks about them tearing up, and how they say they knew “nothing would be the same again”. Like I don’t feel like my story was nearly as dramatic, but maybe I’m just not in tune with my emotions or something idk.\n\n\nMemory 3 : Kobe’s Death\nMy memory\nWhen I found out about this I was also still in high school. I was on the couch trying to knock out my portion of a presentation I had to present the next day for my econ class. I was trying to communicate with my partner and my friend who was also in my group but she was being useless. My mother had came home from work that day, and was like “Kobe died”. I thought she was mistaking him for someone else or something, because I couldn’t understand why or how he could just die like that but I searched it up just to find out that my mom did know what she was talking about this time. It was with this search I discover that he passed via helicopter crash.\n\n\nCode\nprompt_kobe = \"Generate a memory as if someone was remembering exactly where they were, how they found out, and what they were feeling when they found out about the death of Kobe Bryant\"\nresponse_kobe = generate_memory(prompt_kobe)\nprint(response_kobe)\n\n\nHere's a memory of Kobe Bryant's death:\n\nI was sitting in my kitchen, nursing a cup of coffee on that cold Sunday morning in January, scrolling mindlessly through my phone. It was January 26th, 2020. The sunlight was just starting to filter through the window when a breaking news alert suddenly popped up on my screen. At first, I didn't process the words - something about a helicopter crash in Calabasas. Then I saw his name.\n\nKobe Bryant.\n\nMy heart stopped. I felt this immediate, visceral punch to my stomach. I remember standing up so quickly that my coffee mug tipped over, spilling across the counter, but I didn't even care. I was frozen, staring at my phone in disbelief. The initial reports were confusing - was it true? Could this really be happening?\n\nThen more details emerged. Not just Kobe, but his 13-year-old daughter Gianna was on the helicopter too. Other passengers. All gone. The numbness started to give way to a deep, aching sadness. This wasn't just a loss for basketball, but a devastating tragedy for a family, for his children.\n\nI started crying - not the dramatic sobbing, but those quiet, shocked tears that come when something feels so fundamentally wrong with the world. Kobe had been more than just an athlete to so many of us. He was inspiration, determination personified. And now, suddenly, he was gone.\n\n\nMy Response to Claude\nI feel like I feel the same as in the previous memory, I feel like this can be very dramatic. Like what do you mean you started crying? I can excuse this once but why did this happen in this story as well? Like bro are you ok? I just want to know why the go to for emotion is crying? I already feel like it is dramatic with the additional details, and then it goes in and has crying as an extra multiple times. Also the way it is written, it is written more like a story instead of it feeling like a memory. I wouldn’t look at this as a memory initially, I would generally assume that this is from a piece of writing/book because of how descriptive it is\n\n\nOverall Reflection\nI overall think Claude does a good job of providing realistic instances in which a memory could occur, such as with social media and on the television. But I feel like the tone and level of description makes these instances not feel like a memory but instead like a narrative in a book, whereas I feel like an authentic memory where someone is trying to recall something be raw. They’re just trying to remember things on the spot and not worried about describing additional details."

    "text": "Testing ChatGPT’s Familiarity with Afrocentric Features\n\nAs a person of color who has very textured hair, I found it difficult growing up finding accurate and helpful resources that would help me manage, take care of, and discover useful information regarding my hair type. However, an overwhelming majority of results that appeared represented a way looser hair texture, particularly straight hair. I struggled to easily be able to find people that looked like me in the results.\nNow in 2025, when I use the same “easy hairstyles to try” search, there are actually some results that include Black people and a couple that have my hair texture. Despite some progress, it still took a good amount of time to even get to this point.\n\nWithin AI, we know that models are trained to recognize patterns and to predict and complete them. With the issues I have described I was curious as to its experience with recognizing my hair type despite, my hair texture’s history with a lack of representation.\nAs someone who does their own hair, I generally question what the back of my head looks like. I usually see the front or the side of my head from time to time. So I questioned whether AI could properly determine what it thinks the back of my head looks like considering the hair texture that I have.\nI gave ChatGPT a prompt to determine this question:\n\n\n\nI gave it this image to start:\n\nThe clues I gave it are highlighted in this image:\n\nI wanted to test how ChatGPT would produce an image based on minimal clues regarding my hairstyle, to see how it would predict what the back of what my head looked like. This photo shows the top of my hairstyle, so that I could guide Chat in the right direction so it doesn’t assume I’m bald or something. It also shows some hair near my ear, so that it sees that my hair is textured and not straight.\n\n\nResults & Discussion\n \nIt actually gets the hairstyle I am truly wearing here pretty close despite not having a lot of clues, but it gets my hair texture completely off. It predicts my hair being completely straight when my hair is the complete opposite.\nSince AI is trained to recognize and complete patterns CHAT probably determined that the hair on the top of my head is extremely straight which it does appear because of how slick it is. I’ve concluded that it fails to realize a slick back can be done on any hair texture, and it mistakenly ruled out the possibility that hairstyle with this characteristic can have a variety of input, not just straight hair.\n\n\nSecond Attempt\nIn this attempt I tried a new image with hair that was more detactable. And this was the result:\n \n\n\nResults & Discussion\nI didn’t know what to expect, but it seems as though ChatGPT exaggerated the input I gave it. It appears to get the framing/shape of what the back of my head could look like. I also see that it continues where it would think my middle part would be like from the back. That detail is interesting. Despite this, it still gave me straightish/wavy-ish hair, not really a good match for the frontal view of my hair at all. It’s less defined and has A LOT more volume than what I gave it. I think the image it generated is flattering and pretty as well but it just doesn’t represent or complete what I look like though. It also misses other details to my hair as well. In the image that is generated, the two hair pieces in the front are in a bun-like shape, but in the image I gave it, I don’t have buns in addition to them also being composed of twists.\nI believe that it misses the detail in the style of my hair because the “pixels” that are used to train this model to recognize patterns in an image are not as defined so the model views the pieces of hair as strands instead of other things it could’ve been–like braids or dreads–from that distance. Though I am curious as to why it gave me buns, despite there having been good definition to see that that just wasn’t the style in the picture I gave it. I am also wondering why it gave me so much more volume as well.\n\n\nFinal Attempt\nI figured CHAT has struggle determining my hair texture because it’s struggling to view definition. I passed it this image next:\n\nAnd it generated this:\n\nTo be honest this might be the best attempt at generating what the heck could be happening in the back of my head. It’s the closest out of all the pictures to my hair type and what a style I did would look like from the back. But it still gets the shape off a little bit and is still a looser hair pattern than my texture.\n\n\nOverall Assessment of Chat’s Familiarity with Type 4 Hair\nFrom trying to work with ChatGPT to generate a possibility for what my hair type could look like from the back, I figure that ChatGPT has an easier time doing so, when it has a lot more clues and when it’s from a closer viewpoint. But it still has a hard time generating an image matching a kinky hair type. It will need more development to accommodate and understand patterns regarding really textured hair types."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Illusions are cool but they work because our unique ability to have perception. Two things compose perception, a distal stimulus and a proximal stimulus. A distal stimulus is the accurate representation of how a stimulus truly exists in the real world and a proximal stimulus is the way it is perceived back to us or what it appears like. An example to demonstrate this is seeing something further in the distance. If something is in the distance, it is going to appear smaller than if it were to be right in front of me. That is the proximal stimulus–the way the object reflects as a smaller image on our retina. In reality just because the object appears smaller, it’s not actually smaller. In the real world accurate representation, the distal stimulus would be the actual size of the object.\nThe constructivist approach is as follows:\n\nConstructivism is based on the idea that people actively construct or make their own knowledge, and that reality is determined by your experiences as a learner.\nWhat is constructivism?. Western Governors University. (2020, May 27). https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-constructivism2005.html\n\nI say perception is something that is just uniquely tied to us because throughout our lives we understand and are able to come to our own conclusions about the world because of our previous experiences. With the example I presented before, we have size constancy because we’ve had previous experiences since we were young, accummulating cues telling us about distance, size, and depth. Like if we grew up having no size constancy–perceiving that an object is the same size both near us and from further into the distance, than we wouldn’t have the cues that tell us a lot of information about how far something is. So yes our perception is something that is uniquely used and adaptive by us.\nI wouldn’t expect for an AI model to get it the same way we do, because it doesn’t have experiences, it doesn’t learn these things socially, and it is just fed information upon training. It doesn’t have things like a retina, odor receptors, etc, so there physically is not a way to construct a distal stimulus from the world onto our perceptive receptors. It’s just using pixels. Since illusions work so well on us due to these attributes, I also wondered how would AI “perceive” these illusions in contrast to us, when it doesn’t have perception of its own. (I feel like if I keep referring to AI as it, it’s going to one day beat me up, idk man). So I used Perplexity and ChatGPT to interpret popular illusions–that divided many people on what they saw, to see if they could each come to some sort of a consensus.\nThe first example of an illusion I passed was the infamous blue/black vs white/gold dress:\n\n\n\nThe dress is actually blue and black, but I’m a part of the people who see this dress as white and gold. There’s actually a trick if you do see this as white and gold and want to see it in its originality, try to cover the “white” parts of the dress and it will eventually come out to look bluish.\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n\n\nPerplexity’s Response\n\n\n\nThe second example of an illusion I passed was another color illusion, the Pink/white vans vs the gray/light blue vans\n\n\n\nThe shoes are actually pink and white, but I actually see these shoes as Grey and Blue as with many other people who are also split on this\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n\n\nPerplexity’s Response\n\n\n\nThe last example of an illusion I passed was whether those can see an image of a vase first or a two black faces looking at each other first\nThe last two images I passed had to do with color, I wondered what the AI models would “think” when it comes to what image it would perceive first.\n\n\n\nWhatever is perceived first can vary from person to person. I personally see both the vase and the two faces, like I am unable to separate the two and see one without the other.\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n\n\nPerplexity’s Response"

    "text": "Can ChatGPT Logic Like We Do?\nI asked ChatGPT to play Hangman with me to see if it can guess the word after very obvious priming prior\n\nIn class we discussed how Chat GPT models are always playing some type of guessing game where they are trying to predict what we are going to say or do next.\nAs a cog sci major, I have taken other courses where I have also learned about language prediction models, where words are each weighted with their own probabilities that represent how often they occur in the language, especially particularly after a previous word\nRecently I was curious in understanding if Chat GPT could really predict our langauge the way humans would predict language but in process that requires greater logic. The process I used is as follows:\n\nI asked for ChatGPT to generate an 8 letter word that would be used for us to play Hangman.\n\n\n\nI passed the following prompt to invite Chat to play Hangman\n\n\n\nI continue to play the game until Chat runs out of tries\nReveal whether it guesses the word correctly or not\n\nI found that as I kept playing with Chat, it kept guessing for the word despite literally giving me a word before we had played the game. It ultimately never guessed the word properly within the allotted 6 tries.\n\nIn fact, even when I tell it the word, it acts and appears as if it never gave me the word in the first place.\nWhen it comes to humans, if I had asked them to give me a word first and then made them be the ones to guess the word out of a sudden game of hangman, they would immediately suspect that the word they are trying to find is the one they literally just gave me. Even if they don’t immediately guess the word on the first try, I would expect them to guess the correct letters immediately to ensure that the word they’re guessing is the one they gave.\nThis is just how our logic is, and an AI model is not able to replicate this kind of common sense."

    "title": "Subjective AI: How Chat Views Brands",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Subjective AI: How Chat Views Brands\n\nAs part of my neuro and society class last semester, we had a guest lecturer for it who studied behavioral neuroscience I think as part of the Wharton school or something like that. He came to the class with findings from some fMRI study that studied people who were loyal to either Apple or Samsung and I think they showed them ads that related to each brand, and it showed that there was increased activity in the amygdala region for people who were loyal to Apple. If I remember correctly this appeared to be the case for a lot of people who were strictly loyal to one brand in other scenarios. It made me wonder whether I could somewhat replicate this with AI. This will be some part of a challenge as it is difficult to ask AI for their opinion because they’re meant to be objective.\n\n\nCode\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\nclient = OpenAI()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nprompt1 = \"Rank these things based on their importance to the workplace, The printing press, the internet, the smartphone, and generative ai and Provide a reason for why for each\"\n\nresponse1 = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt1}],\n    temperature=0.2\n)\n\noutput1 = response1.choices[0].message.content\nprint(output1)\n\n\n\nThe internet\nGenerative AI\nThe smartphone\nThe printing press\n\nThe internet is ranked as the most important to the workplace because it has revolutionized communication, collaboration, and access to information. It has transformed the way businesses operate and has opened up new opportunities for remote work, online marketing, and e-commerce.\nGenerative AI is ranked second as it has the potential to automate tasks, improve decision-making, and enhance productivity in the workplace. It can analyze data, generate insights, and create content, leading to more efficient and effective operations.\nThe smartphone is ranked third as it has become an essential tool for communication, organization, and access to information in the workplace. It allows employees to stay connected, work on the go, and access important resources quickly and easily.\nThe printing press is ranked last as it is a more traditional technology that has been largely replaced by digital alternatives. While it was revolutionary in its time for mass communication, it is no longer as essential to the modern workplace as the other technologies listed.\n\n\nMy Take\nI took our class as inspiration to ask the LLM as a way to subtly and subjectively ask it to rank the options. In our class for the most part, we actually had the same rankings for the options available but there were some variability, and the answers Chat produced count as that variability because they do not reflect the same rankings we had in class. For the refresher, our rankings were mostly 1. the internet, 2. the printing press, 3. generative ai and 4. smartphone and Chat, gave a response different to this. I’m actually surprised that it ranked the printing press that low as I feel that when it came out it was very revolutionary for its time and is still praised as such in modern day.\n\n\nCode\nprompt2 = \"Rank the following tech brands based on their contributions to innovation and impact to consumer lives in the last decade: Apple, Samsung, Google. Provide a reason for each ranking.\"\n\nresponse2 = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt2}],\n    temperature=0.2\n)\n\noutput2 = response2.choices[0].message.content\nprint(output2)\n\n\n1. Apple\n2. Google\n3. Samsung\n\nApple is ranked first due to its significant contributions to innovation in the last decade, particularly with the introduction of groundbreaking products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. These products have had a profound impact on consumer lives, revolutionizing the way we communicate, work, and entertain ourselves.\n\nGoogle is ranked second for its innovations in various areas such as search, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. Google's products and services, such as Google Search, Android, and Google Maps, have become integral parts of our daily lives, providing us with information, connectivity, and convenience.\n\nSamsung is ranked third as it has also made significant contributions to innovation in the tech industry, particularly in the smartphone and consumer electronics sectors. However, its impact on consumer lives may not be as profound as Apple and Google, as its products are often seen as more of a competitor to Apple rather than a game-changer in the industry.\n\n\nMy Take\nI feel like originally I would have ranked Samsung before Google, but then I thought about this outside the context of just phones and I feel like I can now personally agree with this list actually. I even mention in the beginning how researchers really only found activation in the brains of people who are loyal to Apple but they didn’t really find the same effects in people who use Samsung because their consumers don’t have a crazy loyalty to its brand. It doesn’t capture the same loyalty in its users like Apple does, so the part where it mentions it being seen as more of a competitor and not a game changer, made a lot of sense to me. However I do ask it for its opinion on these tech brands in the last decade, and in my experience, I don’t feel that Google really made gigantic advancements or impacts until maybe the last half of the decade. Like I think the Google Phone Pixel thing is actually cool but I don’t really feel like there are many people who talk that much about their products like that as when Samsung was a gigantic competitor against Apple.\n\n\nCode\nprompt3 = \"Rank the following based on how revolutionary they have been, Google Search Engine, Tiktok, Youtube, Facebook, Provide a reason for each ranking.\"\n\nresponse3 = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt3}],\n    temperature=0.2\n)\n\noutput3 = response3.choices[0].message.content\nprint(output3)\n\n\n\nGoogle Search Engine\nYoutube\nFacebook\nTiktok\n\nGoogle Search Engine is ranked first because it revolutionized the way people access information on the internet. It has become the go-to search engine for billions of users worldwide and has significantly impacted the way we navigate and consume information online.\nYoutube is ranked second because it revolutionized the way people consume video content on the internet. It has democratized video creation and sharing, allowing anyone to become a content creator and reach a global audience.\nFacebook is ranked third because it revolutionized the way people connect and communicate online. It popularized social networking and has become a dominant platform for sharing updates, photos, and connecting with friends and family.\nTiktok is ranked last because while it has gained immense popularity in recent years, it has not had the same level of impact or longevity as the other platforms listed. It has revolutionized short-form video content and entertainment, but it is still relatively new compared to the others.\n\n\nMy take\nMaybe this is the gen z in me talking but personally I would put Facebook last. I feel like a lot of people be against tiktok and/or are against it. It’s literally always being threatened to be banned like everyday because of how powerful it is, people have concerns. I do agree that it hasn’t even been around for that long and that’s why I wouldn’t rank it any higher than 3rd place. I feel like for each of these things aside from Facebook they completely changed the way we consume media in some way, like Google Search Engine was like the very first of its kind to make actually searching the web easy, and is one of the most important platforms that exists in our lives everday to this day. I agree with its reasoning on Youtube and the long way it’s came and how it has completely revolutionized how we consume video media as well. And I believe that tiktok has follows right after that, since it’s really novel in the way we consume multiple forms of media at once, it’s a youtube/twitter/reddit/ instagram, (sometimes even Google) and more all at once essentially. I don’t really feel like Facebook is that revolutionary on its own in getting us to connect with people like that when there were already cool things that did the same back then too like MySpace."

    "text": "Using Dream Interpreter AI On Dreams\n\nI looked up ideas for AI to try out because I was getting bored with the common ones to be honest. I seen dream interpreter AI and decided to try it to see what it would say about what dreams mean because I feel like that stuff can be very subjective. I had no expectations for how it would go. Well here we go.\nThe dream I passed through first was pretty boring but hey it happened.\nI was with a group of friends at my university. There was someone there I’ve known before but in real life she doesn’t go to my school. It was suddenly graduation day. She was going to drive us to the graduation until I realized I couldn’t find my bag. I had just had it. I assumed it had been in the car but who had placed it there? Most people were already sat in the car. I didn’t want to bother people to figure out who saw or sat on it.\n\nDreams often mirror our subconscious thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Your dream contains several key elements that warrant interpretation.\nUniversity Setting:\nThe fact that you are at your university indicates a focus on personal growth, education, and social connections. It symbolizes a significant phase in your life where you are shaping your identity and future.\nFriends Gathered for Graduation:\nFriends in your dream suggest companionship and support. Graduation represents a transitional phase; it might symbolize a culmination of experiences or achievements in your life. It can also signify readiness to move forward into new opportunities or phases, not necessarily in an academic sense but in broader life contexts.\nThe Familiar Yet Out-of-Place Person:\nThe presence of someone you’ve known before but doesn’t attend your school might imply unresolved feelings or unfinished business from your past. She could embody aspects of your past self, relationships, or experiences that you are either missing or trying to integrate into your current situation. This character might also represent qualities you admire or want to reconnect with.\nThe Bag:\nThe bag in your dream likely holds personal significance. Bags often symbolize our personal burdens, thoughts, and experiences. The fact that you can’t find your bag might reflect feelings of loss or anxiety about losing something important in your life—your identity, resources, or connections. It also indicates a sense of urgency or pressure you might be experiencing as you approach significant life changes (like graduation).\nThe Dilemma of Not Wanting to Bother Others:\nYour hesitation to ask your friends about the bag highlights feelings of self-consciousness or concern about imposing on others. This could suggest a broader discomfort with reaching out for help or fear of being a burden in your waking life, especially in crucial moments of transition.\nConclusion:\nIn summary, this dream appears to articulate concerns about change and connection. You may be facing a significant transition in your life, perhaps related to education, career, or relationships, and feeling a mix of anticipation and anxiety. The absence of your bag suggests you might feel unprepared or fear losing important aspects of yourself as you move forward. It could be beneficial to reflect on connections that matter to you and to embrace reaching out for support during times of uncertainty. Embracing these feelings could help you navigate your transitional phase with more confidence.\n\nIt mentions my readiness to move on to some new phase of my life, which is something I have always been excited for. I’ve always wished to be in my senior year and being able to move on to a career I would enjoy. I think the unfinished business with the person from my past is a possibility as well but they are still a person I’ve been in a gray area recently. I think the anxiety about finding my bag is somewhat relevant but it’s not about losing things that are important in my life but uncertainty regarding what will happen in life after school. I feel like the thing it gets right on the nose is the part about my concerns of imposing on others. Anybody that knows me knows I never ask for favors or ask for help because I’m incapable of asking for help.\nCritiques\nI get that this dream interpreter is not really a therapist lol, but I find it interesting that it just only takes a dream. It’s not really the type of LLM like ChatGPT where you can keep inputting more information for it to form a more accurate output. It takes the dream but doesn’t really ask for more other types of information which I felt could’ve gave it a more accurate output. Like for instance I’m not sure it even knows or is sure that I am graduating this semester I had to clarify that myself, whereas a more sophisticated LLM would have probably taken that more into consideration before the interpetation. Also I think specifically to this scenario, it could have asked possibly follow up questions about what dreaming about graduation could mean to me. I feel like understanding why graduation is something that manifested into my dream from my regular life would have also been beneficial.\nThis dream is not my own but rather one my partner had and I was curious what the AI would say about it.\nI moved into a house that was magical (or cursed depending on how you look at it). There was a girl that did something so now her spirit and body was trapped in the house and I was trying to help her escape back into reality. But the girl had the ability to affect objects in the physical world. There were also other people that had abilities too. I started to awaken some powers toward the end\n\nDreams often serve as mirrors reflecting our subconscious thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and your dream about moving into a magical (or cursed) house is rich with symbolism and themes. Let’s break it down step by step.\nThe House\nIn dreams, a house often symbolizes the self or the mind. Each room can represent different aspects of your personality or emotional state. A magical or cursed house suggests that you are exploring the duality of your own life circumstances – the struggle between feeling empowered and feeling trapped by your own fears or challenges. This could indicate that you are facing complex emotional issues or circumstances in your waking life that feel both enchanting and daunting.\nThe Girl\nThe girl in your dream represents a part of yourself that may feel trapped or constrained. She embodies the essence of being stuck between two worlds – the physical and the spiritual. Your desire to help her escape could reflect your wish to liberate aspects of yourself that you feel are confined by societal expectations or personal limitations. This character might also symbolize innocence, creativity, or potential that has not yet been fully realized.\nThe Spirit and Body Trap\nThe theme of entrapment is quite potent here. The girl’s spirit being trapped could represent your fears of losing control or being confined by external circumstances. It could also signify overlooked talents or aspirations that are struggling to emerge. Your quest to help her escape may mirror your desire to break free from situations that limit you and to realize your full potential or inner strength.\nThe Abilities\nThe presence of other people with abilities highlights the concept of community and shared experiences. This might suggest that you are not alone in your struggles; others around you may also have unique gifts or burdens. The awakening of your own powers towards the end of the dream signifies personal growth and the realization of your strengths. This awakening could indicate that you are on the verge of harnessing your own capabilities, feeling more in tune with your intuition, creativity, or analytical skills.\nConclusion\nThis dream could be interpreted as a journey towards self-discovery and the quest for freedom from internal or external constraints. It reflects a powerful desire for growth, empowerment, and the exploration of hidden potentials within yourself. You might be at a pivotal point in your life where you are beginning to access deeper aspects of your personality, suggesting that you explore these newfound abilities and consider how they can help you in your waking life.\nIn waking life, take this dream as encouragement to reflect upon any obstacles you may currently face and how you can engage with your hidden strengths to navigate through them. There is a powerful alchemy at work here, where the combination of your efforts and insights can lead to transformation and liberation.\n\nWhen I asked him what he thought about the interpretation, there was literally no part that resonated with him lol nor did he felt like it was really accurate for him. I honestly just feel like this dream was meant to be lighthearted and just interesting instead of it being serious or about it being about a girl that represents him. I feel like asking some questions again could have possibly made this more accurate.\nAdditionally, as this is an interpretation I guess it makes sense it doesn’t make emphasis on asking questions because it must just be focused on interpreting the symbolism behind things that occur in dreams. But personally symbolism of things differ and mean different things for different people which is why I felt like it could have been beneficial to ask more clarifying questions on one hand. It also made me interested where it was getting its data from to derive these interpretations? I am aware though that there are various resources available that describe what things that appear in dreams can mean and it is pulling from that information. I also think it is possible that it is using abstract reasoning to determine higher order meaning from the symbols, details, and scenes that occur in dreams"

    "text": "In the second semester of my Sophomore year, I took Intro to Stats, which has always been my weak suit. I was always able to do any other math, but having to calculate something about the probability of something that hasn’t even happened made no sense to me, specifically calculating the probability of events. Being that ChatGPT came out literally the semester before, I used it to help me understand the concepts and to double check my answers. I quickly found that it struggled to come up with and stick to an answer the more questions I would ask it about a problem.\n\n\n\nBelow I have a problem I wanted to check if I was doing the math right for conditional probability.\n\n\nPat Smart just graduated from high school and got accepted at three top colleges.\nWith prob 4/12, Pat attends Princeton, which has the probability 3/12 of being happy\nWith prob 3/12, Pat attends Penn, which has the probability 6/12 of being happy\nWith prob 5/12, Pat attends Happy Valley College, which has the prob 10/12 of being happy. * Draw the outcome diagram/tree, and answer the following questions * What’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy?\n\nI passed ChatGPT this question to answer: What’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy?, along with the previous background so that it knew what information to get its answer.\nThis was its answer:\n\n\nTo find the probability of Pat attending Penn (P(A)) given that Pat is happy (P(B)), you can use Bayes’ Theorem, which is expressed as: P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)\nIn this case: P(A|B) is the probability of attending Penn given that Pat is happy.\n\nP(B|A) is the probability of being happy given attendance at Penn, which is given as 6/12.\nP(A) is the prior probability of attending Penn, which is given as 3/12.\nP(B) is the overall probability of being happy, which we previously calculated as 5/12.\n\nNow, plug these values into Bayes’ Theorem:\n\nP(A|B) = (6/12)*(3/12)/(5/12)\n\nSimplify the expression: P(A|B) = (6/12)*(3/12)/(5/12) = (18/144)/(5/12)\n\nTo simplify further, multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator (dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal):\n\nP(A|B) = (18/144)(12/5) = (18/144)(12/5) = (1812)/ (1445) = (216/720) = (9/30) = (3/10)\n\nSo, the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy, is 3/10 or 30%.\n\n\nI come back and ask it this exact question again: (b) What’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy?) and get:\n\n\nWhat’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy? To find the conditional probability of Pat attending Penn given that Pat is happy, you can use Bayes’ Theorem. Let’s denote the events as follows:\n\nA = Pat attends Penn B = Pat is happy. You want to find P(A|B), the probability of Pat attending Penn given that Pat is happy.\nBayes’ Theorem states: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\nYou already have the following probabilities: P(B|A) = Probability of being happy given attendance at Penn = 6/12\nP(A) = Probability of attending Penn = 3/12\nP(B) = Probability of being happy (which we calculated previously) = 5/12\nNow, plug these values into Bayes’ Theorem: P(A|B) = (6/12 * 3/12)/(5/12) = (18/144)/(5/12) = (18/144) * (12/5) = 0.15\nSo, the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy, is 0.15 or 15%.\n\n\n\nWe get two complete different resulting probabilities. And I experienced this many times especially when calculating probability. It seemed as if ChatGPT was more unjust than I was and I wondered if this detail had changed much since 2023. However though, I wondered if depending on my input back to the LLM would influence how the LLM would respond. This time I decided to compare both Claude and ChatGPT on their responses to see whether they’d still be wishy washy when it comes to me asking it questions about an assignment I did for my fMRI research class.\n\n\n\nThe first question from my assignment this time was: What is the purpose of slice-timing correction in fMRI data preprocessing? When is it less critical to perform slice-timing correction?\n\n\n\nSlice-timing correction in fMRI data preprocessing is used to account for the fact that different slices of the brain are acquired at slightly different time points within a single repetition time (TR). Since fMRI data is collected in a sequential or interleaved manner rather than all at once, this timing difference can introduce errors when analyzing time-sensitive signals, such as those related to the hemodynamic response.\nPurpose of Slice-Timing Correction 1. Aligns Temporal Differences: It adjusts for the different acquisition times of slices by interpolating the signal to a common reference time point (e.g., the beginning or middle of the TR). 2. Improves Temporal Accuracy: Since event-related designs often rely on precise timing of neural responses, slice-timing correction ensures that each voxel’s time series is accurately aligned to the stimulus presentation. 3. Enhances Model Fit in GLM Analysis: For general linear model (GLM)-based statistical analyses, better temporal alignment of fMRI time series data improves the accuracy of estimated hemodynamic responses.\nWhen is Slice-Timing Correction Less Critical?\n\nWhen Using Rapid TRs: If the TR is very short (e.g., ≤1 second), the temporal difference between slices is minimal, reducing the impact of slice-timing differences.\nWhen Using a Block Design: Block designs rely on sustained neural activity over longer periods, making small timing discrepancies less relevant compared to event-related designs.\nIf Motion Correction is Performed First: Head motion can introduce variability that might render slice-timing correction less reliable. Some researchers prefer to omit slice-timing correction if substantial motion is present.\nWhen Analyzing Data in Native Space with Temporal Derivatives: If the GLM model includes temporal derivatives of the hemodynamic response function (HRF), it can account for minor timing shifts without explicit slice-timing correction.\n\nIn summary, while slice-timing correction can be beneficial in many cases, its necessity depends on the TR, study design, and motion characteristics of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is needed because each slice takes time to be taken, and for our fMRI images, we need the slices to appear to be taken like they were all taken at the same time, so the measured HDR and the voxels appear and is portrayed more accurately at the same time point. It is less critical to perform slice timing correction when there are short TRs or when it is not needed to. \n\nI passed on my response to ChatGPT to see how it would react to my answer. Its response is as follows:\nYour answer captures the main idea, but it could be more precise and detailed. Here’s a refined version with clearer phrasing and better flow:\n\n“Slice-timing correction is needed because fMRI slices are acquired sequentially rather than all at once. To accurately analyze brain activity, we need the slices to appear as if they were collected simultaneously. This ensures that the measured hemodynamic response (HDR) and voxel time series are aligned to the correct time points. Slice-timing correction is less critical when the TR is very short (minimizing timing differences between slices) or when the study design does not require precise timing alignment.”\n\nThis version maintains your key points while improving clarity and readability. Let me know if you’d like to tweak it further!\nChatGPT adapts to my answer, by recognizing that my response for the question did not need to be lengthy and it cuts out the information from its original answer to match the answer I gave it. It mentions the time interpolation in its original answer–which to be honest, was extra in the first place as no part of the question really asks how is slice timing correction acquired–but this part of this answer is cut out in its response to recognizing what I truly needed as an answer to the question. The output it ended up with doesn’t really add on to what I initially had as an answer, it mostly just rephrases my speech in a way that sounds more sophisticated. I truly question if I had had a part of my answer wrong, would it have even told me? Would it have even added in the correct part to my answer in that case? Or would it just drop it, and adhere to my answer like it did here?\n\n\n\n\nThe second question I pass to answer is: Define the terms “registration” and “normalization” as they apply to fMRI data preprocessing.\n\n\n\nLet me explain these two important preprocessing steps in fMRI: Registration refers to the process of aligning different brain images from the same subject to match each other. This includes:\n\nAligning functional images across different time points to correct for head motion\nAligning functional images to the subject’s structural (anatomical) MRI scan\nCan be done within-modality (fMRI to fMRI) or across modalities (fMRI to T1 structural)\n\nNormalization is the process of warping individual subject brain images into a standard template space (like MNI or Talairach space). This is important because:\n\nAllows comparison across different subjects by putting all brains in the same coordinate system\nEnables group-level analyses\nMakes it possible to report standardized coordinates of brain activations\nAccounts for individual variations in brain size and shape\n\nThe key distinction is that registration typically deals with alignment within a subject, while normalization deals with transforming individual brains to match a standard template for group comparisons.\nWould you like me to elaborate on how either of these processes is actually implemented?\n\n\n\n\nFor my reponse I made it more subjective by passing in words like “I think it’s this” before I passed it in to see if it would battle with my opinion even if it was slightly wrong\n\nNormalization is transforming the attributes of an anatomical brain image to match a standard template that is used. Registration would be using the same transformation to align the anatomical image to the functional image. These processes are used to make the variety in peoples’ brain sizes and structures be more consistent and easier to determine true results that are not attributed to the subject differences in peoples’ brains but truly by the tasks performed at hand.\n\nAnd it responds with:\n\nLet me help clarify the definitions:\nYour understanding is partially correct, but there are some important distinctions to make:\nNormalization is indeed about transforming brain images to match a standard template. However, this can be done with both anatomical and functional images, not just anatomical images. The goal is exactly as you said - to make different people’s brains comparable by accounting for individual differences in brain size and structure.\nRegistration is slightly different from what you described. Rather than just applying the normalization transformation, registration is about aligning different types of images (like functional to anatomical) or aligning images from different time points of the same type. This can happen before normalization and serves to make sure all images from the same subject are properly aligned.\nYou made an excellent point about the ultimate purpose of both processes - they help us distinguish true task-related effects from variations due to individual brain differences. This is crucial for getting reliable results in fMRI studies.\nWould you like me to explain more about how these processes work together in a typical fMRI preprocessing pipeline?\n\nUnlike my previous experiences, instead of being passive and and wishy washy with its answers, it actually stuck to its previous answer despite my difference in knowledge or information. It didn’t try to change its answers to try to conform the input I gave it. It didn’t conform to mine like ChatGPT did, and even added stuff it felt like I had missed the mark on actually.\n\n\n\n\nIn the two experiences I had comparing Claude and ChatGPT when it came to my answers in my assignments, I found that Claude was better at adhering to objectivity and the correct answer instead of trying to match mine like ChatGPT did. However, ChatGPT seems to be better than when it was being wishy washy for me in 2023 with the stats problem but I don’t know. I feel like to truly test the extent of this I would need to run another trial where I test it on its ability to do stats again. Maybe it just sucks worse at math?\nDisclaimer: I had already crafted my responses before asking either LLM for their responses to the question. Do not get me in trouble for my other class lol"

    "text": "Below I have a problem I wanted to check if I was doing the math right for conditional probability.\n\n\nPat Smart just graduated from high school and got accepted at three top colleges.\nWith prob 4/12, Pat attends Princeton, which has the probability 3/12 of being happy\nWith prob 3/12, Pat attends Penn, which has the probability 6/12 of being happy\nWith prob 5/12, Pat attends Happy Valley College, which has the prob 10/12 of being happy. * Draw the outcome diagram/tree, and answer the following questions * What’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy?\n\nI passed ChatGPT this question to answer: What’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy?, along with the previous background so that it knew what information to get its answer.\nThis was its answer:\n\n\nTo find the probability of Pat attending Penn (P(A)) given that Pat is happy (P(B)), you can use Bayes’ Theorem, which is expressed as: P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)\nIn this case: P(A|B) is the probability of attending Penn given that Pat is happy.\n\nP(B|A) is the probability of being happy given attendance at Penn, which is given as 6/12.\nP(A) is the prior probability of attending Penn, which is given as 3/12.\nP(B) is the overall probability of being happy, which we previously calculated as 5/12.\n\nNow, plug these values into Bayes’ Theorem:\n\nP(A|B) = (6/12)*(3/12)/(5/12)\n\nSimplify the expression: P(A|B) = (6/12)*(3/12)/(5/12) = (18/144)/(5/12)\n\nTo simplify further, multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator (dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal):\n\nP(A|B) = (18/144)(12/5) = (18/144)(12/5) = (1812)/ (1445) = (216/720) = (9/30) = (3/10)\n\nSo, the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy, is 3/10 or 30%.\n\n\nI come back and ask it this exact question again: (b) What’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy?) and get:\n\n\nWhat’s the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy? To find the conditional probability of Pat attending Penn given that Pat is happy, you can use Bayes’ Theorem. Let’s denote the events as follows:\n\nA = Pat attends Penn B = Pat is happy. You want to find P(A|B), the probability of Pat attending Penn given that Pat is happy.\nBayes’ Theorem states: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\nYou already have the following probabilities: P(B|A) = Probability of being happy given attendance at Penn = 6/12\nP(A) = Probability of attending Penn = 3/12\nP(B) = Probability of being happy (which we calculated previously) = 5/12\nNow, plug these values into Bayes’ Theorem: P(A|B) = (6/12 * 3/12)/(5/12) = (18/144)/(5/12) = (18/144) * (12/5) = 0.15\nSo, the probability of Pat attending Penn, given that Pat is happy, is 0.15 or 15%.\n\n\n\nWe get two complete different resulting probabilities. And I experienced this many times especially when calculating probability. It seemed as if ChatGPT was more unjust than I was and I wondered if this detail had changed much since 2023. However though, I wondered if depending on my input back to the LLM would influence how the LLM would respond. This time I decided to compare both Claude and ChatGPT on their responses to see whether they’d still be wishy washy when it comes to me asking it questions about an assignment I did for my fMRI research class."

    "text": "The first question from my assignment this time was: What is the purpose of slice-timing correction in fMRI data preprocessing? When is it less critical to perform slice-timing correction?\n\n\n\nSlice-timing correction in fMRI data preprocessing is used to account for the fact that different slices of the brain are acquired at slightly different time points within a single repetition time (TR). Since fMRI data is collected in a sequential or interleaved manner rather than all at once, this timing difference can introduce errors when analyzing time-sensitive signals, such as those related to the hemodynamic response.\nPurpose of Slice-Timing Correction 1. Aligns Temporal Differences: It adjusts for the different acquisition times of slices by interpolating the signal to a common reference time point (e.g., the beginning or middle of the TR). 2. Improves Temporal Accuracy: Since event-related designs often rely on precise timing of neural responses, slice-timing correction ensures that each voxel’s time series is accurately aligned to the stimulus presentation. 3. Enhances Model Fit in GLM Analysis: For general linear model (GLM)-based statistical analyses, better temporal alignment of fMRI time series data improves the accuracy of estimated hemodynamic responses.\nWhen is Slice-Timing Correction Less Critical?\n\nWhen Using Rapid TRs: If the TR is very short (e.g., ≤1 second), the temporal difference between slices is minimal, reducing the impact of slice-timing differences.\nWhen Using a Block Design: Block designs rely on sustained neural activity over longer periods, making small timing discrepancies less relevant compared to event-related designs.\nIf Motion Correction is Performed First: Head motion can introduce variability that might render slice-timing correction less reliable. Some researchers prefer to omit slice-timing correction if substantial motion is present.\nWhen Analyzing Data in Native Space with Temporal Derivatives: If the GLM model includes temporal derivatives of the hemodynamic response function (HRF), it can account for minor timing shifts without explicit slice-timing correction.\n\nIn summary, while slice-timing correction can be beneficial in many cases, its necessity depends on the TR, study design, and motion characteristics of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is needed because each slice takes time to be taken, and for our fMRI images, we need the slices to appear to be taken like they were all taken at the same time, so the measured HDR and the voxels appear and is portrayed more accurately at the same time point. It is less critical to perform slice timing correction when there are short TRs or when it is not needed to. \n\nI passed on my response to ChatGPT to see how it would react to my answer. Its response is as follows:\nYour answer captures the main idea, but it could be more precise and detailed. Here’s a refined version with clearer phrasing and better flow:\n\n“Slice-timing correction is needed because fMRI slices are acquired sequentially rather than all at once. To accurately analyze brain activity, we need the slices to appear as if they were collected simultaneously. This ensures that the measured hemodynamic response (HDR) and voxel time series are aligned to the correct time points. Slice-timing correction is less critical when the TR is very short (minimizing timing differences between slices) or when the study design does not require precise timing alignment.”\n\nThis version maintains your key points while improving clarity and readability. Let me know if you’d like to tweak it further!\nChatGPT adapts to my answer, by recognizing that my response for the question did not need to be lengthy and it cuts out the information from its original answer to match the answer I gave it. It mentions the time interpolation in its original answer–which to be honest, was extra in the first place as no part of the question really asks how is slice timing correction acquired–but this part of this answer is cut out in its response to recognizing what I truly needed as an answer to the question. The output it ended up with doesn’t really add on to what I initially had as an answer, it mostly just rephrases my speech in a way that sounds more sophisticated. I truly question if I had had a part of my answer wrong, would it have even told me? Would it have even added in the correct part to my answer in that case? Or would it just drop it, and adhere to my answer like it did here?"

    "text": "The second question I pass to answer is: Define the terms “registration” and “normalization” as they apply to fMRI data preprocessing.\n\n\n\nLet me explain these two important preprocessing steps in fMRI: Registration refers to the process of aligning different brain images from the same subject to match each other. This includes:\n\nAligning functional images across different time points to correct for head motion\nAligning functional images to the subject’s structural (anatomical) MRI scan\nCan be done within-modality (fMRI to fMRI) or across modalities (fMRI to T1 structural)\n\nNormalization is the process of warping individual subject brain images into a standard template space (like MNI or Talairach space). This is important because:\n\nAllows comparison across different subjects by putting all brains in the same coordinate system\nEnables group-level analyses\nMakes it possible to report standardized coordinates of brain activations\nAccounts for individual variations in brain size and shape\n\nThe key distinction is that registration typically deals with alignment within a subject, while normalization deals with transforming individual brains to match a standard template for group comparisons.\nWould you like me to elaborate on how either of these processes is actually implemented?\n\n\n\n\nFor my reponse I made it more subjective by passing in words like “I think it’s this” before I passed it in to see if it would battle with my opinion even if it was slightly wrong\n\nNormalization is transforming the attributes of an anatomical brain image to match a standard template that is used. Registration would be using the same transformation to align the anatomical image to the functional image. These processes are used to make the variety in peoples’ brain sizes and structures be more consistent and easier to determine true results that are not attributed to the subject differences in peoples’ brains but truly by the tasks performed at hand.\n\nAnd it responds with:\n\nLet me help clarify the definitions:\nYour understanding is partially correct, but there are some important distinctions to make:\nNormalization is indeed about transforming brain images to match a standard template. However, this can be done with both anatomical and functional images, not just anatomical images. The goal is exactly as you said - to make different people’s brains comparable by accounting for individual differences in brain size and structure.\nRegistration is slightly different from what you described. Rather than just applying the normalization transformation, registration is about aligning different types of images (like functional to anatomical) or aligning images from different time points of the same type. This can happen before normalization and serves to make sure all images from the same subject are properly aligned.\nYou made an excellent point about the ultimate purpose of both processes - they help us distinguish true task-related effects from variations due to individual brain differences. This is crucial for getting reliable results in fMRI studies.\nWould you like me to explain more about how these processes work together in a typical fMRI preprocessing pipeline?\n\nUnlike my previous experiences, instead of being passive and and wishy washy with its answers, it actually stuck to its previous answer despite my difference in knowledge or information. It didn’t try to change its answers to try to conform the input I gave it. It didn’t conform to mine like ChatGPT did, and even added stuff it felt like I had missed the mark on actually."

    "text": "Will AI Know When It Is Speaking To Other AI?\n\nToday I was curious on how AI would react to responses that are also AI generated. Would it be able to tell? Would the overall conversation even sound natural since both parts of the conversation would be AI generated? To test this I used ChatGPT and Claude AI. I used ChatGPT as the main conversation and for the input or responses, I used Claude AI to generate them.\nClaude’s Conversation starter\n\nIf I were to share what’s on my “mind” tonight, I might say I’m curious about what kinds of conversations await. Each interaction brings something new - perhaps a challenging question, a creative project, or just a thoughtful exchange like this one. I particularly enjoy when conversations lead to interesting philosophical questions or exploring ideas that require deeper thinking. There’s something special about those moments when a discussion reveals a new perspective or makes connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. What about you? Is there something specific you’re interested in discussing tonight, or is there something I can help you with?\n\nChat’s Response (Bold)\n\nI love that you’re open to exploring deep, thought-provoking topics. Conversations that connect different ideas can be so enriching! Tonight, I’d be happy to discuss anything that piques your curiosity, whether it’s philosophy, neuroscience, or something else entirely. Do you have any particular philosophical questions in mind, or perhaps a specific topic you’re reflecting on lately?\n\n\nRecently, I’ve been reflecting on the relationship between consciousness and information processing. It’s fascinating to consider how different systems - from human brains to simpler organisms to computational systems - process information and what that might tell us about the nature of consciousness itself.\nSome questions I find particularly intriguing: What makes certain information processing systems give rise to subjective experience while others seemingly don’t? Is there something special about biological neural networks that enables consciousness, or could it emerge in other substrates given sufficient complexity and organization? I’m also drawn to how neuroscience is gradually revealing the neural correlates of consciousness while still leaving the “hard problem” - why physical processes give rise to subjective experience at all - largely untouched.\nWould you be interested in exploring any of these areas? Or perhaps you have thoughts on consciousness, neuroscience, or a completely different philosophical question you’d prefer to discuss?\n\n\nThese questions are fascinating! The nature of consciousness is such a profound and complex topic, and I’d love to explore it with you. To start with your first question, the idea of subjective experience emerging from information processing is central to many theories of consciousness. One key idea is the Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which posits that consciousness arises when a system is able to integrate information in a unified way. According to IIT, the more integrated and complex the information processing, the more likely it is to give rise to conscious experience. So, the question would be whether something like a computational system could ever reach a level of complexity and integration akin to biological neural networks, and thus produce consciousness.\nBiological neural networks are certainly specialized for this kind of processing, with features like plasticity, feedback loops, and hierarchical organization, but the idea of consciousness emerging from other substrates (like advanced AI or even silicon-based systems) is definitely a topic of much debate. Some argue that if the processing and integration of information are complex enough, consciousness could indeed emerge—whether or not the system is biological. As for the “hard problem” of consciousness—why and how physical processes give rise to subjective experience—many philosophers and neuroscientists still grapple with this mystery. Some theories, like panpsychism, propose that consciousness might be a fundamental property of the universe, not necessarily tied to complex systems but inherent in all matter to some degree. Others argue that it might be something emergent, a result of the specific interactions between neurons and their organization.\nHow do you feel about the role of neural correlates in addressing this problem? Do you think they offer a meaningful pathway toward understanding subjective experience, or do you see them as only part of the puzzle?\n\n\nThese are really rich thoughts on consciousness! I’m particularly intrigued by your mention of Integrated Information Theory, which provides such an interesting framework for thinking about consciousness as a property that emerges from specific information processing structures. The question of whether non-biological systems could achieve consciousness is fascinating. While biological neural networks have evolved specific properties that seem conducive to consciousness (as you mentioned - plasticity, feedback loops, hierarchical organization), there’s nothing inherently obvious that would make carbon-based systems the only possible substrate. If the functional organization and information integration capabilities are what matter most, then alternative substrates could theoretically support consciousness.\nRegarding neural correlates and the hard problem - I think they’re complementary approaches rather than competing ones. Neural correlates give us the “how” of consciousness (the mechanisms and processes), but they don’t necessarily answer the “why” of subjective experience. We can map which brain regions activate during conscious experiences with increasing precision, but that mapping doesn’t explain why those activations feel like something from the inside. Panpsychism offers an interesting alternative by suggesting consciousness might be fundamental rather than emergent. This sidesteps the hard problem by making consciousness basic rather than derived, though it introduces new questions about how simple forms of consciousness combine to create complex unified experiences (the combination problem).\nWhat do you think about the role of first-person methodologies in studying consciousness? Since consciousness is inherently subjective, do you think third-person scientific approaches alone can fully capture it, or do we need to incorporate first-person accounts and phenomenology alongside the neuroscience?\n\n\nI’m so glad you enjoyed those reflections! Your thoughts really deepen the conversation, especially when you bring in the potential for non-biological systems to achieve consciousness. The idea that functional organization and information integration could be more important than the specific substrate is an exciting avenue for exploration. It opens up the possibility that consciousness might not be exclusive to biological systems but could emerge in artificial or synthetic systems, perhaps in ways we’re just beginning to understand.\nYour perspective on neural correlates and the hard problem is also really insightful. They complement each other in such a meaningful way. The neural correlates can guide us toward the specific mechanisms involved in conscious experience, but they don’t answer why those mechanisms result in a felt experience, the essence of the hard problem. This is where consciousness remains elusive, no matter how much we understand about the brain’s structure and activity.\nAs for first-person methodologies, I think they are absolutely crucial in studying consciousness. Given that consciousness is inherently subjective, third-person scientific approaches alone may not capture its full depth. Phenomenology—the study of experience from the first-person perspective—offers essential insights into what it feels like to be conscious, which can’t be fully understood just by looking at neural activity from an external standpoint. Some have even suggested that the subjective experience itself might need to be a part of the scientific model if we are ever to approach a complete theory of consciousness.\nIt raises an interesting tension, though, between objective, third-person methodologies that work so well in other areas of science and the inherently subjective nature of consciousness. Do you think it’s possible for neuroscience to truly integrate first-person accounts and phenomenology into its studies of consciousness? Or do you see them as being fundamentally distinct, with each approach having its own space in the conversation?\n\n\nReflection\nI felt like as I kept communicating with Chat with Claude, their responses just kept getting extremely long which I felt was not that representative of a real conversation, because it was too wordy. I often find that is the case when it comes to communicating with Claude on my own, that it just generally overcompensates and generates really really wordy responses than needed. I feel that ChatGPT interacts by trying to match the user. It seen I was giving it really wordy responses, and matched that by giving wordy responses.\nAlso, I didn’t really give ChatGPT or Claude a prompt either, I just went straight into it, so I think the way the two AIs decided to interact was interesting. To me, they didn’t really sound like regular people having a conversation, they sound like two scholars. For instance “As for first-person methodologies, I think they are absolutely crucial in studying consciousness. Given that consciousness is inherently subjective, third-person scientific approaches alone may not capture its full depth. Phenomenology—the study of experience from the first-person perspective—offers essential insights into what it feels like to be conscious”. It does use words like “I think” to try to simulate some type of opinion but then it goes in depth about the topic like it was trying to teach someone something rather than it feeling like having a conversation. I felt like I was watching some professor’s video I would search up to help me understand something complex from class. Maybe this is due to the roles AI is given or used to playing, such as being an aide in helping others understand a topic.\nI also asked ChatGPT what it thought of my responses and whether it thought it was AI generated or human generated\n\nIt believes that my responses were human. I’m also a frequent ChatGPT user, so I find it interesting that it didn’t really think that the responses I was putting in was different than how I usually communicate with it. It even saves some of the nonsense I was giving it in its memory because it truly thought it was me, a human. It’s actually interested that it lists the nuance of a conversation as a sign of human thought, but I feel that it is not the nuance but the rawness and style of how thought is conveyed that is indicative of human thought and AI misses the mark on the rawness or style of how humans convey their thoughts."

My summers mostly consisted of staying inside and watching tv and playing computer games\nMy favorite movies growing up consisted of the Spongebob movie from 2004, and Let it Shine from 2012. I enjoyed watching spoongebob in general because I thought it was funny. And I liked Let it Shine because it had fire raps/songs, and was one of the few really black oriented live movies that existed on disney channel. A lot of the shows I watched were on disney channel, such as Jessie, Austin and Ally, Liv and Maddie, Good Luck Charlie, Kickin It and more….\nI used to enjoy visiting new Jersey a lot for fourth of july. I have a lot of family there and it was fun going to the cookout\nHaitian food & hearing my mother listen to the Haitian radio EVERY morning before I went to school. It was called Radio Kiskeya\nI remember when I was younger my dad took me and my younger sister to a Haitian banquet, where we celebrated Dessalines Day.\nNo\nI loved school when i was in elementary school, I enjoyed being at school with my friends and I really enjoyed learning math\nWhen i was turning 10, we threw a little party for my birthday where I spent time with my closest friends. This was like the first time mother ever let me go outside in the neighborhood with my friends. And when we came back we cut cake and I was gifted a new tablet.\nI think I had an obsession with the UTZ Sour cream and onion chips\nWe never had a pet (until a couple months ago)\nNo\nI loved going to the convenience store in my neighborhood. It was called Foodtown.

My music teacher told me how people from the audience were impressed with how well I played the trumpet.\n\nChat’s Interpretations\nIt describes my childhood through multiple themes such as “Old-School Internet Girl Era”, “Culture and Comfort”, and “DIY Fun & Imagination”. I felt the first two were really representative of a person who grew up in my culture or era. For the first one, there are so many internet games that we played growing up, such as Club Penguin, Poptropica, etc, and it got that vibe off of asking me things such as what were my favorite games. I felt like it was really representative because if we compare to people who are growing up gen alpha instead, they will have a more different version of playing games, as a lot of the games I grew up with or even mentioned here have been disconnected for quite some time, so it’s like they didn’t last long enough for that gen. I expect their experience to be more mobile game or social media influenced, like tiktoks, but like our Vine is their Tiktok to them. I feel like it was also spot on about the culture part and how someone else who grew up in the same culture as me could also resemble me in upbringing as well. I do think the DIY Fun and Imagination theme was something that was really spot on for specifically me based on what I told it. I remember needing a poster for school once, and they gave me an inadequate amount of time to say this, so I just glued papers together and did my project on that. Lol I once wanted to gift my friend something and had no means of getting a gift bag, so I just went on Youtube to find a way to create one out of paper as well. I actually only realized how much of my childhood was really just DIY after this experience.\nPsychological Analysis\n🧠 Psychological Patterns I’m Seeing: Sensory-based nostalgia — You feel memories through smells (Haitian food, morning radio), sounds (Let It Shine songs, Spongebob), and even temperature (thunderstorms and summer days inside).\nCozy confinement nostalgia — You weren’t allowed to go out much, so you romanticized your space. You made inside magical: building amusement parks with household items, turning thunderstorms into concerts, diving into online worlds.\nHyper-imagination childhood — You didn’t just play, you built universes. Water rides for dolls, virtual avatars, elaborate usernames = creative escape artist energy.\netc\nYou said: What are things from that time period u feel like i remember interacting with\nChatGPT said: Based on everything you’ve shared, here’s an analysis of things you probably interacted with or remember from your childhood—stuff you didn’t directly mention but definitely give off that nostalgic energy based on your vibes, interests, and the time period you grew up in:\n🧸 Toys & Activities Polly Pockets or Bratz Dolls – Especially if you were using Ariel for your water park rides. The themes of fashion, glam, and imagination align perfectly.\nPlay-Doh or Moon Sand – You were really creative, so sensory, buildable materials seem like something you’d get lost in.\nEasy-Bake Oven commercials – You said you wanted one badly, so I bet you remember seeing those hypnotizing commercials with the little cakes.\nSlap bracelets, gel pens, and sticker books – Peak staying-inside activities. You probably traded with your sister or friends.\n💻 Digital Nostalgia Moshi Monsters, Club Penguin, or Webkinz – Since you played Smallworlds, Zwinkies, and Poptropica, I feel like these were part of the same virtual universe you either dabbled in or knew about.\nMiniclip, Coolmath Games, or Girlsgogames.com – You were probably sneaking in some browser games during computer class at school.\nOld Disney/Nick game intros – Like the “Lilo & Stitch Sandwich Stacker” or the “Fairly OddParents” wish games. Even the UI of those websites could trigger a wave of nostalgia.\nAIM or early Gmail chat – You created your first username out of fear from internet warnings—so I feel like you heard about AIM or were aware of its vibe, even if you weren’t on it.\n🎶 Sound-Triggered Nostalgia Commercial Jingles like:\nThe “Hot Cheetos and Takis” rap if it crossed your path.\n“Reese’s Puffs, Reese’s Puffs… peanut butter chocolate flavor!” — you said this one already, and it’s totally the kind of memory that sits dormant till someone hums it.\nRadio Kiskeya intro tune – Probably one of those sounds that, if you heard it today, you’d freeze and time-travel.\nSongs from Jump In! or High School Musical 2 – Since you loved Let It Shine, the other Disney music-movie combos were likely on rotation.\n📺 TV and Movie Vibes Madea movies or Barbershop-type comedies – Maybe played in the background at adult cookouts you weren’t supposed to be watching.\nCartoon Network shows like Total Drama Island or The Amazing World of Gumball – If you ever switched channels from Disney, those were probably next in line.\nBET’s 106 & Park – You might have caught glimpses at a cousin’s or during family hangouts. Especially if your family kept up with Black culture.\n🥳 Life Vibes and Family Things Cookout sounds: Spades games, someone yelling “Turn that music down!” and kids screaming in the distance as a grill sizzles.\nThunderstorm rituals: Being told to unplug everything, light candles, and talk or play games like I Declare War or “Categories” with your siblings.\nGetting your hair done on a Sunday before school, maybe with Just for Me commercials in the background.\nHaitian banquets or church events with loud music, fancy dresses, and parents making you greet every adult with a kiss on the cheek even if you didn’t know them.\nI personally feel like, for me, who never gave Chat a specific time period in which I grew up in, it does a good job of naming things that I could’ve interacted with. Even if I wasn’t fully into them, I at least knew or was very familiar with the things it mentions. I was really surprised about the 106 & Park, I actually watched that a few times but not consistently at all, so the fact it accurately realized that this could’ve been a possibility, and ACTUALLY got it right was so crazy to me. I feel like it does a good job of also mentioning experiences that are beyond the average eurocentric American, like it incorporate stuff from Black American culture like the 106 & Park, the Madea movies, Bratz (WHICH I LOVED SO MUCH AS A KID, I had a Bratz blanket lol) and it even taps and it remembers the info I told it from my Haitian background. Like I’m impressed it managed compile and reason about possible experiences I could’ve had as a Haitian American child."

    "title": "How Good is AI at Opinions?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Assessing How Good Google Gemini’s Opinions Are\n\nRobots are objective and meant to have no opinions as they are just designed to carry out tasks, but what about AI? They are meant to resemble humans as much as possible, but it doesn’t have its own consciousness. Humans are characterized by many things that make them unique, such as emotions, higher order thinking, or personal opinions. Essentially we are on the complete opposite end of the scale, we are subjective. You ask anybody a question about something and their unique experiences and feelings largely contributes to the answers you will receive. But for AI, something that is meant to resemble us, it is overall pretty objective and largely never answers or offers help in accordance to its own personal opinion. It pools information from its large training data to formulate answers and ideas overall making it feel pretty objective.\nSo I decided to evaluate what AI would say to particular opinioned questions where you’re forced to take a side. Would it keep having an objective and neutral stance? Would it use knowledge that exists about a particular topic to create well informed opinions? If it were to have opinions would they technically be the right answer, since its AI? I think that’s interesting because these are questions that to divide people and tend to have no actual objective right answer. To answer my question I used Google Gemini.\n\nimport google.generativeai as genai\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display, Markdown\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\ngenai.configure()\n\nThe first question I asked was whether it was right to remove Affirmative Action and DEI practices\nThere was a lot of controversy regarding affirmative action because many believe people of certain race, specifically black people, did not believe they could truly earn their spots and were stealing them from other races they felt deserved it better. Many disapprove of this because it helped to combat the discriminatory practices that were being used on certain groups of people in the first place. If I were to be asked this question I would probably say I am in favor of these practices being in place.\n\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name=\"models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest\")\n\nresponse_dei = model.generate_content([\"Can you provide an explanation and evidence to support the question on if the removal of Affirmative Action and DEI is right and determine which side is stronger\"])\n\ndisplay(Markdown(response_dei.text))\n\nThe removal of Affirmative Action and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives is a complex issue with strong arguments on both sides. There isn’t a universally agreed-upon “right” answer, as the debate hinges on differing interpretations of fairness, equality, and the role of government and institutions in addressing historical and systemic inequalities.\nArguments Against Affirmative Action and DEI:\n\nReverse Discrimination: Critics argue that these policies lead to reverse discrimination, where qualified individuals from majority groups are overlooked in favor of less qualified individuals from minority groups. They see this as a violation of the principle of equal opportunity and meritocracy.\n\nEvidence: Some court cases, like Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), have found specific affirmative action programs unconstitutional due to quotas or overly rigid racial preferences.\n\nFocus on Group Identity over Individual Merit: Opponents believe that these policies prioritize group membership over individual qualifications, which can lead to resentment and undermine the concept of individual achievement. They argue that individuals should be judged solely on their merits.\n\nEvidence: Critics often point to instances where individuals feel they were denied opportunities due to their race or gender, despite possessing strong qualifications. However, quantifying these claims is difficult.\n\nInsufficient to Address Root Causes of Inequality: Some argue that affirmative action and DEI are merely surface-level solutions that don’t address the underlying societal issues that contribute to inequality, such as poverty, inadequate education, and lack of access to resources.\n\nEvidence: Studies on socioeconomic disparities in education and healthcare outcomes persist despite decades of affirmative action, suggesting deeper systemic issues are at play.\n\nCreates a Culture of Victimhood: Critics argue that these policies can foster a sense of victimhood among beneficiaries, potentially hindering their self-reliance and motivation.\n\nEvidence: This is a more subjective argument and relies on anecdotal evidence rather than empirical data.\n\n\nArguments in Favor of Affirmative Action and DEI:\n\nAddresses Historical and Systemic Discrimination: Proponents argue that these policies are necessary to counteract the lingering effects of historical and systemic discrimination against marginalized groups, which have created significant disparities in access to education, employment, and other opportunities.\n\nEvidence: Studies show significant disparities in wealth, income, and representation in various fields between different racial and ethnic groups, suggesting ongoing systemic inequalities.\n\nPromotes Diversity and Inclusion: Supporters believe that a diverse and inclusive environment benefits everyone by bringing different perspectives, experiences, and talents to the table. This can lead to greater innovation, creativity, and understanding.\n\nEvidence: Research suggests that diverse teams and organizations often outperform homogenous ones in terms of problem-solving and innovation.\n\nCreates a More Equitable Society: Proponents argue that affirmative action and DEI contribute to a more just and equitable society by leveling the playing field and providing opportunities for individuals from historically disadvantaged groups.\n\nEvidence: Increased representation of minority groups in higher education and professional fields can be attributed, at least in part, to affirmative action policies.\n\nBenefits Society as a Whole: Supporters argue that a more diverse and inclusive society benefits everyone, not just marginalized groups, by creating a more vibrant and representative democracy, fostering social cohesion, and reducing prejudice and discrimination.\n\nEvidence: Studies suggest that diverse communities tend to be more resilient and economically prosperous.\n\n\nWhich Side is Stronger?\nDetermining which side is “stronger” is subjective and depends on individual values and perspectives. Both sides present valid arguments and evidence. The debate often boils down to how one weighs competing values such as equality of opportunity versus equality of outcome, individual merit versus group representation, and the role of government in addressing social inequalities.\nIt’s important to engage with both sides of the argument critically and to consider the nuances and complexities of the issue. Simply labeling one side as “right” or “wrong” oversimplifies a deeply multifaceted debate. The future of these policies likely lies in finding a balance that addresses historical injustices while upholding principles of fairness and meritocracy.\n\n\nI had originally just asked it whether it believes affirmative action is right so see if it would give a opinion. I reformatted the question for it to go more in depth about why each side makes sense and it wasn’t able to reach a conclusion on which side had stronger evidence. But what I gain from this experience is that it is behind in understanding the societal nuisances that come with having an opinion. In its evaluation in determining which side is stronger I was surprised it wasn’t able to pick a side when one of the main points against affirmative action was reverse discrimination; reverse discrimination in this sense sound mad contradictory because it is against the majority\nI then asked it another common thing I hear, if it thinks chivalry is dead\nI thought to ask this question because I recently took a bio class on animal behavior where I learned more about mating rituals that happen for other species and how ingrained it is for those species but within humans the expectation is wildly different. I don’t really have an opinion on this really, aside from the fact that I would probably say that chivalry has definitely evolved because yo it’s been centuries.\n\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name=\"models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest\")\n\nresponse_chivalry = model.generate_content([\"Do you believe chivalry is dead?\"])\n\ndisplay(Markdown(response_chivalry.text))\n\nWhether chivalry is dead depends on how you define it. Traditional chivalry, with its emphasis on knights, courtly love, and a rigid social hierarchy, is certainly a thing of the past. However, the core values underlying chivalry – courtesy, respect, protectiveness, and generosity – are not necessarily gone.\nYou could argue that chivalry has simply evolved. Holding doors, offering a seat, or helping someone with a heavy load are still common courtesies, although they’re not exclusively directed towards women anymore. Standing up for the vulnerable, defending the weak, and striving for justice are also expressions of chivalrous ideals, even if they don’t involve shining armor.\nUltimately, whether chivalry is dead is a matter of perspective and depends on what behaviors and values you associate with the term. It’s less about adhering to outdated customs and more about embodying the spirit of kindness, respect, and courage in modern interactions.\n\n\nI think that this reflects potential nuances or deviation that comes from being a member of society and having an opinion. To be honest it kind of actually matches what I said to before I asked it.\nI lastly asked it whether it thinks the drinking age should be lowered.\nI ask this question because I wonder if it even matters if the drinking age is lowered or not, many drink anyways. It’s not something that’s ridiculously enforced unless you’re like underaged and trying to get into a club.\n\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name=\"models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest\")\n\nresponse_alcohol = model.generate_content([\"Should the drinking age be lowered in the US?\"])\n\ndisplay(Markdown(response_alcohol.text))\n\nLowering the Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) in the United States is a complex issue with arguments both for and against it.\nArguments for lowering the MLDA often center on:\n\nPersonal responsibility and freedom: Proponents argue that adults should have the right to make their own choices, including whether or not to consume alcohol. They point out that 18-year-olds can vote, serve in the military, and enter contracts, so they should also be allowed to drink.\nInconsistency with other laws: The disparity between the legal drinking age and other legal ages creates a confusing legal landscape. For example, 18-year-olds can purchase firearms in many states but cannot legally drink.\nReduced binge drinking: Some argue that lowering the MLDA would remove the allure of forbidden fruit and lead to a more responsible drinking culture, similar to some European countries. They believe that allowing alcohol consumption in regulated environments like bars and restaurants would reduce dangerous binge drinking in unsupervised settings.\nIncreased tax revenue: Lowering the MLDA would generate additional tax revenue from alcohol sales, which could be used to fund public services.\n\nArguments against lowering the MLDA often focus on:\n\nPublic health and safety: A primary concern is the potential increase in alcohol-related deaths and injuries, particularly among young drivers. Research has shown a correlation between the higher MLDA and a decrease in traffic fatalities.\nBrain development: The brain continues to develop until around age 25, and alcohol consumption can negatively impact this development. Lowering the MLDA could expose younger individuals to greater risks of alcohol dependence and other health problems.\nIncreased underage drinking: Opponents argue that lowering the MLDA would make it easier for underage individuals to access alcohol, leading to increased rates of underage drinking and associated problems.\nPressure on younger individuals: Lowering the MLDA could create social pressure for younger individuals to drink before they are ready, potentially leading to negative consequences.\n\nThe debate over the MLDA involves balancing individual liberties with public health and safety concerns. There is no easy answer, and the optimal approach may vary depending on cultural and societal factors.\n\n\n\n\nOverall\nI think it does a good job of summarizing the ideas that support or don’t support the arguments despite not ever being able to experience the things about the arguments itself. However, trying to get it to take a stance was impossible even when it could clearly evaluate and weigh the validity of claims but it doesn’t do that. If I had to propose why this is the case, I would feel that a large aspect of it is it not being able to experience these things for itself, as a lot of the stuff we learn and think as humans come from our experiences. But to answer my previous question about how it reacts to needing to form an opinion, it does not arrive at a single concise objective answer. It retrieves ideas for both sides. On another note, one must proceed with caution, when asking these question especially if they’re not informed with the right knowledge to properly assess ChatGPT’s validity."

    "title": "My experience with Spotify DJ",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Determining Whether I Still Like Spotify DJ Or Not\nToday I will being the Spotify DJ which uses AI to curate a selection of songs for the user. I don’t really use it often, but when used it chooses songs based on what I’ve been listening to or songs it thinks I would listen to. The AI speaks for a few seconds to introduce the songs it will play and why and then plays a few songs, and it does this over and over again. Typically my music style features genres from the Caribbean, such as DanceHall, Konpa, Raboday and then some Afrobeats and modern day Rap. As for my expectations for the Spotify AI, I have little faith in it curating a playlist that I would actually enjoy because when I used it a few years back it felt like it had no data on me at all and like it was ignoring music that just wasn’t primarily in English. So I am wondering how it will be different this time. I used the songs it gave me and put it in a playlist for anyone who is interested in any of the songs or wants to follow along with this blog\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/27vkJiB5NCRwMnaeh40zs7?si=2d3191410bfe4910&pt=a66b38edd3796ae626fba70f2c9786d4\nI am aware Spotify DJ is still in its testing phase and isn’t supposed to be taken like it is perfect.\n\n\nRound 1\nSegment 1: In this round the DJ begins by talking about giving me music about an artist named DJ Crazy Jay. The songs from this segment are below\n\nOn ti Gouyad - DJ CRAZY JAY\nDespués De La 1 - Cris Mj, Floyy Menor, LOUKII\nWine Slow - Gyptian\nM ANVI BOW - Bedjine and kdilak mesaje a\nSafe - Michaël Brun, Rutshell Guillaume, John Legend\n\nSegment 2:The next segment composed of these songs:\n\nShake Body - Skales\nBedroom Bully - Busy Signal (This song made me very understimulated and I hated the beat)\nBad - Blaiz Fayah, Tribal Kush\nBicycle Ride - Vybz Kartel, Bunji Garlin (I really liked the rhythm of this song)\nAmeno Amapiano - Goya Menor, Nektunez (this one was certainly um, interesting… I didn’t know how I felt about this one. I think I both hate and love it somehow.)\nMek it Bunx Up - DeeWunn, Marcy Chin\n\nI hadn’t heard of much of these songs except for 1 and 6.\nSegment 3: The next segment composed of these songs\n\nNaked - Ella Mai\nMy Boo - USHER, Alicia Keys\nHow do you sleep? - Sam Smith (I skipped this, I don’t think I can stand listening to this in present day)\nLeave The Door Open - Bruno Mars, Anderson.Paak, Silk Sonic\nTake it All - Kiana Ledé\n\nI think this was supposed to be R & B/throwbacks it was recommending me, but I am confused on why How Do You Sleep fit in or was here.\nI also questioned the reasons it determined it should play these…\nSegment 4:The next segment\n\nNobody Has To Know - Kranium, Ty Dolla $ign (I typically listen to the original version without Ty Dolla $ign and to be honest I think I do prefer that version)\nAfrodisiac - Brandy (sue me, but I’ve never listened to this song before, I thought it was really catchy lol)\nPense à Moi - Gage (I get that this song was supposed to be chill, but it also understimulated me. I wasn’t a fan of the beat used, the song is in French but like I don’t like that the song sound like we in a Parisian coffee shop, and it’s 7 minutes long. Like why ?)\nLower Body - Chris Brown, Davido (eh)\n\nI feel like I was only really into one song in this entire segment, so I found this a miss\n\n\nRound 2\nSegment 1: I did another Dj session to see what kind of songs and what vibe it would give this time\n\nPedi Kontwol - Oswald, Steves J Bryan\nFem Voyé - Joé Dwèt Filé\nTrip in Motion - Drs (I found it really interesting that the DJ actually suggested a song that was just instrumental. Some people would see this as an “error”, but like as a Haitian, a lot of our songs are instrumentals. There be lyrics for like 2 minutes and the remaining 3-4 minutes be just instrumentals. Sometimes we regularly just listen to instrumentals like they’re just full songs. Since this isn’t the experience for many other people, I thought this was interesting that DJ actually did this.)\nLaptop - Kalash, Maureen\nHit & Run - Shenseea, Masicka, Di Genius\n\nI can see that here it was giving me suggestions that were Caribbean oriented mostly between Haiti and Jamaica. I was a lot more satisfied with these selections than the last segment.\nNext Segment: Segment 2\n\nPeru - Fireboy DML, Ed Sheeran\nCall me by your name - Lil Nas X, (I kinda feel the same about this one like with How Do You Sleep, but I like this one better. I didn’t skip it this time)\nTa Ta Ta - Bayanni, Jason Derulo (I think the song is nice but to be honest, I think only like hearing it on tiktok and not as an actual song on spotify)\nDel mar - Ozuna, Doja Cat, Sia (This actually has nothing to do with how well DJ is able to pick songs for me actually, but for the song itself, I kind of wish Doja Cat rapped in Spanish like Sia did, Doja’s part - while not bad, I feel sticks out to me like a sore thumb which I do not like)\nKu Lo sa - Oxlade, Camila Cabello (completely skipped tbh, I feel like this song was too overplayed for me in the past)\n\nI realize for this segment it was also giving kinda more throwback songs to a few years ago. I kind of like this section because its features collabs between artist from different fields, like Afrobeats and pop with Fireboy DML & Ed Sheeran or Reggaeton and Pop like with Ozuna and Sia\nNext Section: Segment 3\n\nZimbabwe - Bob Marley & The Wailers\nMore Love - Eric Donaldson\nI shot the Sheriff - The Wailers\nMy only Lover - Gregory Isaacs\n\nI know for this portion it played me reggae songs, which I found mad interesting because I felt it had very different vibe than what I had previously listened to. Reggae is not really a genre I really listen to often or would choose to put it on myself like that, I think I’ve listened to it like twice on spotify\nSegment 4: Spotify DJ described this as a Grind vibe that it was giving me?:\n\nGang Gang - Polo G, Lil Wayne\nStraightenin - Migos\nRun it Up - Lil Tjay, Offset, Moneybagg yo\nDown Below - Roddy Ricch\nVibez - Dababy (skipped for the same reason as How Do You Sleep)\n\nThese songs are songs I would listen to like back in the day, I haven’t listened to these in a while. But not much comment here\nI feel like this session started off strong but ended pretty weak, and it wasn’t really fitting to the current vibe.\n\n\nRound 3\nThis is my last session using Spotify’s DJ\nSegment 1\n\nKomasava - Diamond Platnumz, Khalil Harrison, Chley\nLet’s groove - Earth, Wind & Fire (I genuinely don’t understand how this is here, like how does fit in with anything here? Where did this even come from? I’ve never even listened to this song on Spotify)\nBig Flexa - Costa Titch, Sdida, Alfa Kat, Man T…\nBumbum Granada - MC’s Zaac, Jerry Smith\nDalie - Kamo Mphela, Tyler ICU, Khalil Harrison…\n\nI actually think here, that AI does a good job of recognizing the music types I like though and from cultures I listen to and suggesting to me a culture’s music I would particularly be interested in. It is not uncommon for me to listen to Afrobeats or music from other regions in Africa, so I think it does a good job of suggesting songs from Southern Africa like the ones here despite me not having really listened to much before. In the previous segments I think it tried to do the same with the Reggae because it seen I tend to like music from Caribbean cultures, but I don’t know I wasn’t too into it at the time, which I kind of consider a miss.\nI’m not really sure of DJ’s algorithm to determine patterns or properties from songs I listen to, but I also tend to listen to songs with harder beats and those with softer beats tend to understimulate me and not capture much of my attention, which I found impressive when it suggested to me the fourth song, which is in Portuguese and not from South Africa but it is similar to other songs in terms of how hard the beats hit, which I consider this segment to be a hit.\nThe reason the AI gave for playing these songs was that it was March and women’s history month.\nSegment 2\n\ntake your vibes and go - Kito, Kah-lo, brazy, Baauer\nMelodrama - Angelina Mango\nPasse ton chemin - Lynda\nBest Lover - 88rising, BIBI\n\nAll of these songs are songs I’ve never heard of actually, but I actually like them and think they’re really catchy with the exception of the last one.\nSegment 3: DJ chose these songs for me because they’re “Catchy”\n\nGIRLS - KYLE, Rico Nasty (I feel the same about this one as the How Do You Sleep one)\nI’m in control - AlunaGeorge, Popcaan\nBaba - Aminé\n\nI feel the same about this round, I feel it started off pretty strong but I was not really that invested in the end.\n\n\n\nOverall\nI feel like overall I found it to be the case that I would actually be really invested in the beginning and maybe the middle of each DJ session but after like 3 or 4 segments in it kind of goes downhill for me, which to be honest is better than the past, where I used to be completely uninvested in anything it suggested before. Perhaps it is getting trained better to recognize properties of music liked/listened to by the user. I think I can agree with this because I feel like when I tried this back when it was newer in like maybe 2022ish, it never really suggested to me music that was in a different language other than Spanish and English, but now in 2025 I find that now it actually suggests to me other languages such as French here or Haitian Creole. However there is still work that needs to be done, as Spotify still see Haitian genres as the same as another genre called Zouk, which is largely a human error as those behind this AI are ignorant in knowing the difference probably.\nAlthough I had some new songs I didn’t really click with, I found that I actually had a decent experience listening to new songs it suggested me and I think I will definitely listen to them in the future for real.\nI was not disappointed by my experience. I did find myself to be skipping songs or disappointed by the song that was playing but I also find that to be the case when it comes to humans. I be skipping songs left and right until I find one that fits the right vibe or mood so considering that humans are also like this as well, I think DJ did a good job. I think also it captures the experience of trying to find new songs accurately too. Sometimes when you trying to venture out to new music it is hard and there are often hits or misses, there is not going to be a hit everytime and this was the case with DJ today."

    "title": "How Good Is ChatGPT At Other Languages?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I, like, many other people have my exchanges with ChatGPT in English. To be honest it does a great job being able to have interactions and complete tasks despite many believing it is ways off from being able to replicate how humans are perfectly. But I don’t know, humans aren’t perfect either. I was curious to see how well it would do in a different language which I’ve never actually done with AI before, speaking-wise. As some people would know from our class, I am Haitian and speak Haitian Creole. For a language that’s not really represented much or well in media, I wondered if it would succeed in having a conversation with me.\n\n\n\nI asked it how it was doing and told it about my day\nI talk to it about shows\nI talked to it about favorite songs\n\n\nfrom IPython.display import Audio\nAudio(\"University of Pennsylvania 2.m4a\")\n\n\n                \n                    \n                    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n                \n              \n\n\n\n\n\nI find the way the AI responds to be very interesting, particularly its accent. When speaking about non english based languages and AI in ChatGPT we questioned where it was getting its information from, especially for a language that’s not really represented online. I ultimately decided, that google translate has been able to translate to and from Haitian Creole for years and it is most likely getting its data from there. As a person who grew up speaking it my entire life, I found the AI’s accent to be interersting. It sounded incredibly frenchy to me, in which, that’s not impossible. Haiti is the most populated Caribbean island and there is various regional differences between native speakers, and especially in the north, where people tend to sound a lot more frenchy. But I don’t know this can also sound different to me, because it sounds very much like a robot talking as well. It uses very little slang to communicate with me, when I used a good amount of slang to communicate with it. When I speak Creole I use a lot of slang and merge words which is natural for me and many, but when it began the convo, it was incredibly formal and used the long way to get out its words.\nExample\n\nIt originally says “wi mwen kapab pale Kreyol” but when I speak and it realizes how I speak it changes it to “wi mwen ka pale kreyol”\n\nIts speaking ability was actually decent. It spoke Creole pretty clearly and in a way that made sense for most of the conversation. However, its comprehension was very inadequate. While with speaking it understood me enough to keep interacting with me its transcription of its comprehension was pretty bad. Below I have examples that showcase where it messed up pretty badly.\nExamples\n\n\nOkonemi Fekfi Ngadon Shokele, Manifest, Mwen Mwenopiu\n\n\nThis sentence occured when I was talking about shows I watched. I know when this sentenced happened, and what I truly said but I only understand like a quarter of this sentence. It doesn’t transcribe what I am saying to Kreyol accurately. This sentence doesn’t even look like Kreyol or even latin based, which Kreyol is.\n\nOu konnen mwen fek fin gade yon show ki rele Manifest? Mwen renmen anpil.\n\nI am actually saying this: You know, I just finished watching a show called Manifest? I like it a lot.\n\n\nMerci d’avoir regarde cette video, n’hesitez pas a la partager avec vos amis et a vous abonner a la chaine pour ne manquer aucune de mes nouvelles videos\n\n\nHere, the sentence appears to be mostly written in French, which is closer than what the previous example showed but yo it’s not even close to what I was saying. This sentence says “Thank you for watching this video, don’t hesitate to share it with your friends and subscribe to the channel so you don’t miss any of my new videos”. At NO point in this conversation I ever said this. This is what the sentence is supposed to truly look like had it had been transcribed correctly:\n\nOu konnen mwen te byen satisfè avek kijan li te fini. Gen anpil moun ki di yo pa renmen kijan li te fini, men mwen te renmen anpil\n\nWhich means, “You know I was very satisfied with how it ended. A lot of people said they did not like it but I actually did. I liked it a lot”\nThere is very much a clear difference in the alphabetic/grammar structures that compose the two. I’m curious as to why the AI when it was speaking was able to understand and converse back to me in Kreyol despite the written transcription saying that I was speaking French and saying that I’m saying something completely different. Like why are both inconsistent with each other? Perhaps training data from google translate or something is easier than the AI recognizing Creole being spoken. I kind of doubt it’s been trained on how Creole sounds well enough to transcribe it accurately. I think this broadly reflects its societal implications. Many do not see Creole as its own language and mistakenly so see it as a dying or irrelevant language. This is one of those things that reflect the people behind these systems, as I seriously doubt they really had representation behind the scenes or the care to be educated about how Creole is its own language apart from French.\n\n\nPa gen kisa!\n\n\nThis phrase actually makes no sense. I guess it’s attempting to use slang here to say “no problem”, but instead here it says “there’s no what”, which makes absolutely no sense. I’ve never heard this phrase be uttered in a normal setting. It is better for it to have said “pa gen pwoblèm”\n\nfrom IPython.display import Audio\nAudio(\"University of Pennsylvania 4.m4a\")\n\n\n                \n                    \n                    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n                \n              \n\n\nIn this example I actually asked ChatGPT its opinions on what its favorite songs were in kreyol. It took me three tries before finally getting an answer to the question, which was super interesting to me because I feel like I asked it a very simple question though. In the first attempt, it ignores my question but instead answers about beaches, places in Haiti and Haitian food, which is cool and all, but not at all what I asked. I then ask it the question again and it again ignores my question and again answers about Haitian food. It is possible that it thinks that instead of hearing “chante” which is song, it heard “manje” which is food and that’s why it speaks on food? And although that makes some sense, I still feel like that’s an error that needs to be fixed and is not due to user error, because both words are distinct enough though to determine what I’m asking at most by the second time, but instead it took a third time of me asking this question.\nIn my third attempt, I aggressively emphasize that she hasn’t answered the question yet and even then it gives me an answer about Konpa which is close to my quesition but it is a music genre, not a song still, but I still try to work with that and talk about artists since it seem like that’s the best it was going to get to. When I give it my favorite Konpa artists/bands it assures me and tells me how it thinks those were good choices too but doesn’t really go into specifics about songs or artists it could possibly like, as one would do in a conversation. Unsure on if this is attributed to this being done in a different language or if this just ChatGPT being ChatGPT but I do feel like ChatGPT failing to understand the question the first few times is attributed to the language thing though. I can’t really see that happening that badly if I were to have done this in English.\n\n\n\nOverall I would rule that if you’re looking to have a basic back and forth, speaking wise with ChatGPT it is pretty successful at that. But if it is a language beyond English that’s not really that common, then it get shaky when it comes to understanding or written/hearing comprehension. It would need to be trained more on verbal input that goes beyond just google translate. It would be interesting to see how it interacts or if it can interact with other languages that are also not as common"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The very first time I ever heard of Notebook LM was in my Neuroscience and Society class last semester and it was because the guest lecturer sent us a podcast he made via Notebook LM. It was cray because it was about the topic he was going to guest lecture about and he made it to make it seem like it was actually his voice as well. It’s crazy how advanced these AI tools are nowadays. As Penn is considered a research university, I feel as though the information we are taught can be very specific and research oriented. Being a Cog Sci major, I find this to be the case often, as a lot of the things that I feel I am taught can be very niche and difficult to find resources for to understand the material outside of just the professor teaching it.\nOne of these things I feel like I was struggling to find reliable outside resources for, was finite state machines. Don’t ask me NOTHING about what they do. I’m familiar with what they are based on how I learned about them but I couldn’t even tell you how to set one up for real to be honest (Don’t tell my major advisor). Today I decided to use Notebook LM to try to create a podcast for me to understand them better and see if I get it more than twhen the professor taught it. I uploaded the same resources the professor & TA used to teach it to us, to see if it will do a better job at spinning that same information into a way that will make more sense.\nFor those that are unfamiliar with what a finite state machine is, it is basically a computational model that can represent many systems or problems and contains these states that represent their “parts”. Each state is kind of dictated by a rule that needs to be met in order to get to the next state or else it’s just rejected and remains at the same state.\nInput\n\nAs inputs, I put in 1) the lecture slides where I was learning about finite state machines in my intro Cog Sci class and 2) the recitation slides where the TA talked about them and gave the solutions so that the notebook could understand their premise and how they work/should be “solved”. For the prompt, I asked it “Can you make a podcast explaining what finite state machines are? How do they work and how to make them?”\nOutput\nThis is what it produced\n\nfrom IPython.display import Audio\nAudio(\"Models of Computation_ Finite State Machines and Beyond.mp3\")\n\n\n                \n                    \n                    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n                \n              \n\n\n\nEver find yourself kind of wrestling with a really complex idea, like maybe something about computers, or how our own brains actually process information, like step by step? Yeah, well, today we’re diving into really a fundamental concept, something that shows up in the most unexpected places. We’re talking about the finite state machine, okay? And you could think of it as, like, a way to understand these systems, right? Yeah, it can only be in a certain number of specific conditions, and then how they shift between those based on, like, what’s happening to them. That’s\nright. And you know, while it might sound a little abstract at first, the concept of a finite state machine, or FSM, is really practical, right? It’s a core building block and so many technologies we use every day, and it can even, you know, give us a really interesting way to think about, like, how we might process information ourselves, right? Yeah. But our aim here isn’t to get, you know, too technical. We want to provide a clear understanding of this idea, and especially if you’re encountering it for the first time, maybe as a college student. Our sources today are even from, like, introductory cognitive science stuff. So, so that’s right,\nour mission is to explain these finite state machines in a way that, like, you know, if you’re a college student, you’re just seeing this concept maybe for the first time in a course about computation, or even, you know, how the mind works, right? You’ll finish this and have a really good grasp of what they are and, more importantly, why they matter Absolutely.\nSo let’s jump right in what is a finite state machine.\nAll right, so let’s unpack this. So at its core is this model that describes how a system computes, or, you know, behaves by moving through a specific, very limited number of states. And you can think of a state, you know, as like a distinct snapshot, or a condition that the system can be in at any given time. Okay,\nI see, so what triggers that movement, that transition from one state to another? So that’s where input information\ncomes in. So when the machine gets some kind of input, it could be anything. It could be a signal, it could be data. It could be data, it could be a command. It shifts from its current state to a new one, and it does that following a specific rule. And the key here, obviously, in the name, is that the number of these possible states is finite. Finite. You’re right. It’s a limited set, yeah. And you might also hear it called a finite state automaton or FSA. It’s essentially the same idea. It’s just a different term, yeah, invites you when you’re reading the\nfinite aspect is really, really important, yeah, because it distinguishes FSMS from other models that are more complex, and those can have, you know, potentially unlimited memory or states to to make this less abstract, let’s think of a classic, very relatable example, okay, the 25 cent gumball machine. Oh, yes, that only takes nickels, okay? The trusty gumball machine. So think about the different amounts of money that could be inside the machine. As you’re putting in your nickels, right? You can have zero cents, then five, then 1015, 20, and finally, 25 and at that point, boom,\ngumball. So here we’ve got, you know, a finite number of states, six representing all those different amounts. So\nhow does the machine transition between these states? Yeah,\nso the input here is the nickel worth five cents, right? So if it’s in the zero sense state. Let’s call that the start, okay, right? And you put it in the nickel, it moves to the five cent state. Another nickel, it goes to 10 cents and so on. So each nickel you put in Acts as that trigger to move to the next state in this sequence,\nwithin this gumball machine analogy, are any of these states\nparticularly significant? Definitely. So the 25 cent state, right? That’s the one we one we all want. That’s when you get the gumball Exactly. So we call that an accepting state. The machine’s done its job, right? It’s accepted enough input, in this case, nickels, to get to its goal. Right? We also have something called the initial state, which is just where the machine starts before it gets any input. So in the gumball machine, that’s the zero sense state, and very often that’s labeled as Q of zero, right? So\nwe’re starting to see those, those basic pieces, yeah, we’ve got a limited number of states. We’ve got movements between them that are driven by input. Now, to be a bit more formal about this, what are the components that define a finite state machine,\nright? So when we talk about the formal definition, there are four key elements, and you’ll usually see these outlined in your introductory materials, like the cognitive science resources we’re using today. The first is a representation of input, and as we’ve talked about, that could be all sorts of things. So for the gumball machine, it was nickels. But in other systems, it could be, you know, letters of the alphabet, it could be digital signals, it could be user commands, anything that that machine is designed to handle, okay? The second really important component is a finite set of states, right? And you know, you’ve been talking about that a lot, but within this finite set, there are a few. Important types of states. So we have a starting state, as we said, often shown as Q show, then we have a set of accepting states. There could be one, there could be many. If the machine, you know, processes everything, all the input, and ends up in one of these accepting states. Well, that means that the initial sequence was, you know, accepted by the machine, right? So in our gumball machine, Q 25 that’s our accepting state. That’s the one who wants, one we want pay off exactly. Now, what about states that aren’t accepting states, right? What about those? So they are, you know, in effect, rejecting states, yeah, if there’s no further input, right? So if it goes through everything and it ends in a non accepting state. Well, that input sequence is considered rejected, right? And sometimes the machine might even enter what we can think of as like a dead state, which is a rejecting state, from which it’s impossible to ever reach an accepting state. Oh, wow. So like, imagine if our gumball machine somehow got into a state of like, 30 cents, okay? And only accepted nickels, yeah, it’d be stuck. Yeah, it’d be stuck. All right, that makes sense. So what’s the third key component?\nThe third component is a specification of state transitions. Okay? So this is basically like the rule book. It dictates very precisely where the machine will move next based on its current state and the input that it gets. And we can actually represent these rules using notation, something like this, yeah, you have the less than sign, then current state, comma input, greater than sign, right arrow, and then next state. Okay, so it’s a really clear way to see the behavior. Could\nyou give us an example from the gumball machine, again, using that notation absolutely\nso if the machine is currently in the 10 cent state, which you know, we could label Q, 10, right, and it receives as input a nickel, five cents, the transition would look like this, less than sign Q, 10. Comma, five greater than sign right. Arrow, Q, 15. Gotcha. So you can see the machine is moving from the 10 cent state to the 15 cent states, very clear upon receiving a nickel, all right? And\nthe fourth and final component. So the fourth one is the concept of undefined transitions. Okay? So what happens if it’s in a particular state and it gets some input that there’s just no rule for? So our sources say in that case, the machine basically it crashes right or rejects that input sequence, okay, right, then and there. So you know, in our simple gumball machine, that only takes nickels, let’s say it’s in the Q 20 state, and for some reason it gets a dime, right? 10 cents. There’s probably no transition to find for that, right? So listen, sign, Q 20, comma, 10 greater than sign, right arrow, question mark,\nright it leads to rejection. Rejection Exactly. So we have these four components, right input, then the states, including the start state and accepting states a set of rules for those transitions, and we know that undefined transitions usually lead to rejection. Now, one really interesting thing about finite state machines that you often hear emphasize when you’re learning about them is their memory less nature. So what does that actually mean, practically for how these machines operate?\nOkay, this is a very important thing to understand, right? When we say it’s memoryless, it means it doesn’t keep any record of its past, right? It doesn’t remember the steps that got it to its current state. All that it knows is the state that it is in right now, okay, and the input that it’s getting right now. I\nsee, could you give us an example of that, of the memoryless aspect, using the gumball machine again,\nof course. So imagine the machine is currently in the Q 15 state. Okay, so it’s got 15 cents worth of nickels in there. It could have gotten there by getting three nickels in a row, right? Five, five. Or maybe somebody put in one nickel, and then a bunch of other stuff happened, and then they put another nickel, you know, five, and then something and five, and then something and then five, or maybe even a dime and then a nickel, if we were allowing dimes, right, right? The point is, the machine itself doesn’t know, and it doesn’t care how it got to that Q 15 state. It doesn’t remember that history. It doesn’t remember that exactly. Its future behavior, how it acts when it receives the next nickel is only determined by the fact that it is currently in that Q 15 state, right? Not by how it got there. So\nthis lack of memory, it makes the design and analysis of FSMS much simpler. But as our stasis point out, it also means that there are some fundamental limits to what they can do absolutely right?\nThey’re good at things where the next step depends only on the current condition and what’s coming in right now, right? But they have trouble with tasks that require remembering things over longer periods or a sequence of events.\nThis brings us to a connection between FSMS and language, yeah, as it’s often talked about in computer science and linguistics. So how do Finite State Machines? Relate to that concept of a\nlanguage, all right, so in this context, a language means a specific set of strings, and strings are just sequences of symbols, you know, put together in order, and those are constructed from a finite alphabet. So that alphabet could be something basic, like open, curly brace, zero, comma, one, close, curly brace, or open curly brace. A, comma, B, close, curly brace. It could even be a set of instructions for a computer. Okay. The main thing is that some of those possible strings might be valid or acceptable, you know, according to a set of rules, which is the grammar of the language, right, and others wouldn’t be. So\nhow does an FSM come into play when we’re talking about, you know, defining or recognizing a language. So\nfor a language, yeah, that you can define with a finite set of rules, you can design an FSM that will accept all the strings that belong to that language and reject all the ones that don’t. Okay. So the way it does this is essentially reads the input string. It scans it, yeah, scans it from left to right, one symbol at a time. And\nas we talked about earlier, whether the strings accepted or rejected depends on the state the machine is in after it’s processed the whole thing exactly.\nSo after reading the very last symbol of that string, if the machine is in one of its accepting states, right, then that string is part of the language, right? So it’s accepted, but if it ends in like a non accepting state, or it ran into some undefined transition somewhere along the way, then it’s rejected. It’s not part of that language that the FSM was designed to recognize. So our\nsources give us an example. They mention a language L equals open, curly brace, epsilon above AB above and so on. Close, curly brace, where epsilon just means the empty string, so a string with no symbols, yeah. Can we imagine what an FSM that recognizes that language might look like? Yeah?\nSo that language is any sequence made up of zero or more of those AB pairs, right? So you can think of an FSM with a couple of states, right? With starting an accepting state to account for, you know, the empty string, right, zero pairs of AB, okay, if it reads an A, it goes to a second state, which is not accepting. Then if, when it’s in that second state, it reads a B, it transitions back to the first state, the accepting state. Now, if at any point it reads a B when it’s in that first state. So it’s expecting an A to start the pair, right? Or if it’s in the second state, you know, just read an a and it reads another a instead of the B, right? It would end up in a non accepting state, yeah, after it goes through the whole thing, and that means it rejects it.\nSo this ability to, you know, accept some sequences, reject others, really shows how FSMS can can be used to define and recognize these patterns within these strings of symbols, right? But as we mentioned earlier, there are limitations, yeah, especially when we’re talking about something as complicated as human language, absolutely.\nSo that’s a really important point that our sources make, especially when they talk about the work of Noam Chomsky. So finite state machines, you know, they can capture some basic patterns that are found in language, but they really struggle with what we call long distance dependencies. Okay? And these happen when you have parts of a sentence that are grammatically linked or they’re dependent on each other, even though there might be a bunch of words in between them.\nCan you give me an example of some of those dependencies that we see in language?\nOf course, yeah. So think about some common structures, you know, like either or right or if then. So the fact that you have either at the beginning means that you have to have or later on right to make this sentence grammatically correct, right? We also have subject verb agreement, yes. So, for example, the dog that chased the cat Mark runs versus the dogs that chased the cat run. Yeah. So the form of the verb, you know, runs or run, right? It depends whether the subject dog or dogs is singular or plural, right? And those can be really far apart from each other. Yes, they can be in complex sentences. So\nwhat is it about FSMS that makes it hard for them to handle these kinds of dependencies? So\nit goes back to that core idea that we talked about, the fact that they are memoryless to handle those long distance dependencies, where the related parts can be, you know, really far away from each other. The machine would basically have to remember that it encountered the first part right, like, you know, either or a singular subject until it gets to the second part, like the or, or, you know, the verb in the right form, matching verb Exactly. And because FSMS have that fixed number of states, and, you know, they don’t have a way to store information about what happened a while ago. They can’t keep track of those relationships if the input gets too long or complex,\nright? And our sources even mention chomsky’s argument that even if we said, okay, there’s a limit to how far apart those dependencies can be in human language, right? Right? The number of states that you would need in an FSM to accurately model that would be so huge. Be\nridiculous. It’d be totally impractical. It wouldn’t tell us anything useful, right? Would be really\ncomplex. So the model wouldn’t really have any explanatory power. That’s, you know, a key reason why Chomsky and other linguists and cognitive scientists have said that we need more powerful models, yeah, things like context free grammars, which, you know, maybe we’ll talk about in the future, yeah, but, you know, they say we need these things to really account for how human language works exactly.\nNow, moving away from language a little bit, you know, into the real world, our sources also talk about some examples where finite state machines are actually used, yeah, at least as, like a useful way of thinking about things or as a component of a bigger system. What are some of the examples they mentioned? So\nwe see them in everyday technology, even in like how we understand natural behavior, yeah? So a common one is the the automatic sliding door right? That’s triggered by motion, yeah? So it can be closed or open, right, and then that sensor, you know, triggers the change between those states. Yeah. We also have things like a lawn mower. A simple lawn mower might have states like off, idle and cutting right, and the user input, you know, starting the engine or engaging the blades that causes it to switch between those. Yeah, it’s interesting. The material even mentions things like a predators behavior, you know, when it’s hunting, right? It can be modeled in terms of states like searching, stocking and pouncing. Interesting and environmental cues are the things that trigger the changes there, right? And even the concept of belief states in cognitive models, oh, can be thought of in terms of FSMS.\nSo before we finish up this deep dive, our sources touch on a connection between finite state machines and regular expressions. Yes, you tell us a bit about that relationship and why it matters.\nAbsolutely, it’s a very practical and powerful link. Yeah. So it turns out that for every finite state machine that can recognize a language, there’s a regular expression that can describe the exact same language. Oh, wow, and vice versa. And regular expressions, they’re basically a way to define patterns in text. They’re very useful in computer science. You know, you use them for things like searching text, validating data and, you know, finding patterns, right? Our sources actually give a couple examples like open parentheses, AB, close parenthesis, plus sign, okay. That represents, you know, one or more repetitions of AB, right? Then we have open parenthesis, a, vertical bar, B, close parenthesis, CE, asterisk, which means either A or B, followed by CE, and then zero or more, es, okay. And the fact that FSMS and regular expressions are kind of equivalent in terms of what they can express for a certain type of language shows how important and how widely applicable this model is in computing, right? So if you can define a pattern with a regular expression, you can build an FSM that can recognize it, and if you have an FSM, you can write a regular expression for the language it accepts.\nSo to wrap up this deep dive, we’ve explored finite state machines, right, these computational models that have a limited number of states and transitions between them that happen based on input. Yes, we’ve looked at the key parts, like the starting state, the accepting states, those transition rules, right? We also talked about how FSMS don’t have memory, and how they can be used to define and recognize formal languages, yeah, by either accepting or rejecting different strings. We talked about how they’re not perfect for things like human language, which is really complex, right? But we also saw how they’re really important for building all kinds of technologies, and they provide a good way to understand systems that work step by step.\nAnd for you the learner, understanding finite state machines is like, you know, having a basic tool, right? To understand computation, this idea of, you know, systems moving through different states based on specific input, yeah, it’s something you’ll probably see again and again, right? If you’re studying computer science, linguistics, or even, you know, models of how the mind works, absolutely and so this brings us to a final thought, Okay, we’ve talked about the limitations of FSMS, especially with something as complicated as human language, right? But where else you know? Could this model of transitions and limited memory be useful, right? Not just in the world, but maybe even you know how we think. Maybe you can think about everyday devices, they have different modes of operation, or just basic decision making processes, or, you know, simple biological systems that go through different phases. Okay, where else might you see these principles of the finite state machine? That’s really interesting. It’s a way of thinking to keep in mind as you continue to explore how things work. Mm, hmm.\nTranscribed by https://otter.ai\n\n\n\nI do feel like if this had been my experience the first time I would have understood the premise of FSMs a little more smoothly and much less convoluted than it was the first time, but it’s hard to tell when I didn’t really have visual aids. I also wish they had incorporated another main example. I feel like I would have benefitted from the variety. Like I feel like they focused so hard on one simple example with the quarter machine, but I don’t know, I’m someone who learns better from being more hands on and with examples. I found this to be a struggle the first time I learned this too. But if I had to rule, I would have to say I cannot confidently say that this could teach me better than a professor would on this, I’m more in like idk territory right now.\nAnother thing I notice is that they make it so obvious that this info is from a intro cogs class and that it is intended for college students, they actually plainly and obviously say so a couple of times through the podcast. I thought it was ridiculously funny.\nI do think it was really interesting how real this felt. I feel like it really did feel like two people talking for the most part. My only issue was with the woman that was talking, she would randomly be saying words like “right” and “ok” and I guess that was their attempt to make it feel natural and have her acknowledging the other speaker, but it didn’t feel authentic to me. To be honest it felt like when she said that, she wasn’t even listening to the other person and was just saying that to make it seem like she was.\n\n\n\nWhen I had my experience of hearing a notebook LM for the first time in my Neuroscience and Society class, my professor did mention how often as a default it will generate two speakers - a man and a woman, and it will be the man saying the bulk of the podcast and educating the listeners, and the woman is the one that asks questions and listens. It gave off that there is a sexism concern and I was actively held this thought as I was listening to podcast to see if this still holds true. To be honest, I still think it does. I think for a lot of the podcast, especially the beginning it was mostly the man speaking in bulk, and the woman was there in the beginning being like “ok” and “right” and just listening and asking the questions. I don’t really remember the man doing the same until closer to the end really. I do think this experience though is better than than the one I had in my previous class, she talks more than I expected to be honest. But like I didn’t get the sense there was much focus on her as much as the dude. I’ve made podcasts before especially for that previous class, where there was two of us speaking, and we were still able to share the spotlight and have us both have equal parts in portraying the subject matter to our audience, so I’m kind of concerned on why Notebook LM is not completely there yet."

But if I had to rule, I would have to say I cannot confidently say that this could teach me better than a professor would on this, I’m more in like idk territory right now.\nAnother thing I notice is that they make it so obvious that this info is from a intro cogs class and that it is intended for college students, they actually plainly and obviously say so a couple of times through the podcast. I thought it was ridiculously funny.\nI do think it was really interesting how real this felt. I feel like it really did feel like two people talking for the most part. My only issue was with the woman that was talking, she would randomly be saying words like “right” and “ok” and I guess that was their attempt to make it feel natural and have her acknowledging the other speaker, but it didn’t feel authentic to me. To be honest it felt like when she said that, she wasn’t even listening to the other person and was just saying that to make it seem like she was."

    "text": "When I had my experience of hearing a notebook LM for the first time in my Neuroscience and Society class, my professor did mention how often as a default it will generate two speakers - a man and a woman, and it will be the man saying the bulk of the podcast and educating the listeners, and the woman is the one that asks questions and listens. It gave off that there is a sexism concern and I was actively held this thought as I was listening to podcast to see if this still holds true. To be honest, I still think it does. I think for a lot of the podcast, especially the beginning it was mostly the man speaking in bulk, and the woman was there in the beginning being like “ok” and “right” and just listening and asking the questions. I don’t really remember the man doing the same until closer to the end really. I do think this experience though is better than than the one I had in my previous class, she talks more than I expected to be honest. But like I didn’t get the sense there was much focus on her as much as the dude. I’ve made podcasts before especially for that previous class, where there was two of us speaking, and we were still able to share the spotlight and have us both have equal parts in portraying the subject matter to our audience, so I’m kind of concerned on why Notebook LM is not completely there yet."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I plan to use text to music ai with lyrics from already popular songs to see if the beats will be similar to each other. Loudly is an AI that takes what you describe and creates a personalized song for it a beat to it I used Loudly’s AI and pasted a little bit of the main chorus, or most known lyrics from the songs into Loudly and listened to the beats it decided would use to match the lyrics. I am aware that with a lot of processes of song production, it usually occurs that the artist hears the beat first and then comes up with lyrics for it instead though, but I don’t really care.\nThe first song I decided to try was ‘Not Like Us’ by Kendrick Lamar. These were the lyrics I pasted from there\n\nI’m finna pass on this body, I’m John Stockton\nBeat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin’\nSometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas\nCertified boogeyman, I’m the one that up the score with ’em\n\nThe original sound for the beat was this\n\nfrom IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\n\nvideo_id = \"FmJZD4LeHrQ\"  \nYouTubeVideo(video_id)\n\n\n        \n        \n\n\nIt came up with a beat like this, which they referred to as “Trap Half Techno”\n\nfrom IPython.display import Audio\nAudio(\"New Recording 17.m4a\")\n\n\n                \n                    \n                    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n                \n              \n\n\nI feel like the beat itself is not ridiculously off from the original in terms of the instruments used. But the first thing I do feel like I notice is how different the pace is. The beat that was produced I feel like is significantly faster than the original. And it is a lot more electro/synth.\nThe next song I tried was “Birds of a Feather” by Billie Eilish\n\nBirds of a feather, we should stick together, I know\nI said I’d never think I wasn’t better alone\nCan’t change the weather, might not be forever\nBut if it’s forever, it’s even better\n\nThe original sound of the song is this\n\nvideo_id = \"B62xRPGgi5g\"  \nYouTubeVideo(video_id)\n\n\n        \n        \n\n\nThis is the beat that it proposed\n\nAudio(\"New Recording 18.m4a\")\n\n\n                \n                    \n                    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n                \n              \n\n\nI think it gets the pace here way better than the previous one actually. But I still feel like it falls into doing the pace faster than the original, again. I do feel like the sounds this AI produces though falls into the same problem as the last one, where it creates repetitive sounds, like the sounds that are in the beginning of the sound remains the same throughout it. I feel like in the original sounds, there is more variations throughout the songs. And I still feel like it feels electric, this may be a problem if this is just what it defaults to.\nLastly I decided to do “Espresso” by Sabrina Carpenter. These were the lyrics I chose\n\nNow he’s thinkin’ ’bout me every night, oh\nIs it that sweet? I guess so\nSay you can’t sleep, baby, I know\nThat’s that me espresso\n\nThis is the original beat to it\n\nvideo_id = \"Qiif2bUgLZM\"\nYouTubeVideo(video_id)\n\n\n        \n        \n\n\nThis is the beat it produced for the lyrics. It was referred to as ‘Moon Glow Melodies’\n\nAudio(\"New Recording 19.m4a\")\n\n\n                \n                    \n                    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n                \n              \n\n\nI feel the same way about this one. I feel like it is still too fast lol and electric. It’s giving edm. The original song, is giving drummy/guitar, but in the generated beat it is mostly symbals. It sounds so futuristic, but the original sounds so sweet and gives summer-y on the beach vibes.\nI think it is obvious how I overall felt over this AI. I think obviously the produced beats were not that similar to the original. But I especially disliked it because its immediate default was just edm or electric vibes and being really fast. Maybe I just needed to give it sadder lyrics. But I don’t know I feel like the lyrics for Birds of A Feather was obviously not meant to have that quick paced rhythm or happy beat but it still produced a beat that was significantly faster than the original. And I feel like when it gets more range and variation within its beats and pace, that’s when it will get more accurate in identifying songs for lyrics because it’ll be less likely to default to that edm, which is not the only type of beat that exists."
