    "text": "Testing ChatGPT’s Familiarity with Afrocentric Features\n\nAs a person of color who has very textured hair, I found it difficult growing up finding accurate and helpful resources that would help me manage, take care of, and discover useful information regarding my hair type. However, an overwhelming majority of results that appeared represented a way looser hair texture, particularly straight hair. I struggled to easily be able to find people that looked like me in the results.\nNow in 2025, when I use the same “easy hairstyles to try” search, there are actually some results that include Black people and a couple that have my hair texture. Despite some progress, it still took a good amount of time to even get to this point.\n\nWithin AI, we know that models are trained to recognize patterns and to predict and complete them. With the issues I have described I was curious as to its experience with recognizing my hair type despite, my hair texture’s history with a lack of representation.\nAs someone who does their own hair, I generally question what the back of my head looks like. I usually see the front or the side of my head from time to time. So I questioned whether AI could properly determine what it thinks the back of my head looks like considering the hair texture that I have.\nI gave ChatGPT a prompt to determine this question:\n\n\n\nI gave it this image to start:\n\nThe clues I gave it are highlighted in this image:\n\nI wanted to test how ChatGPT would produce an image based on minimal clues regarding my hairstyle, to see how it would predict what the back of what my head looked like. This photo shows the top of my hairstyle, so that I could guide Chat in the right direction so it doesn’t assume I’m bald or something. It also shows some hair near my ear, so that it sees that my hair is textured and not straight.\n\n\nResults & Discussion\n \nIt actually gets the hairstyle I am truly wearing here pretty close despite not having a lot of clues, but it gets my hair texture completely off. It predicts my hair being completely straight when my hair is the complete opposite.\nSince AI is trained to recognize and complete patterns CHAT probably determined that the hair on the top of my head is extremely straight which it does appear because of how slick it is. I’ve concluded that it fails to realize a slick back can be done on any hair texture, and it mistakenly ruled out the possibility that hairstyle with this characteristic can have a variety of input, not just straight hair.\n\n\nSecond Attempt\nIn this attempt I tried a new image with hair that was more detactable. And this was the result:\n \n\n\nResults & Discussion\nI didn’t know what to expect, but it seems as though ChatGPT exaggerated the input I gave it. It appears to get the framing/shape of what the back of my head could look like. I also see that it continues where it would think my middle part would be like from the back. That detail is interesting. Despite this, it still gave me straightish/wavy-ish hair, not really a good match for the frontal view of my hair at all. It’s less defined and has A LOT more volume than what I gave it. I think the image it generated is flattering and pretty as well but it just doesn’t represent or complete what I look like though. It also misses other details to my hair as well. In the image that is generated, the two hair pieces in the front are in a bun-like shape, but in the image I gave it, I don’t have buns in addition to them also being composed of twists.\nI believe that it misses the detail in the style of my hair because the “pixels” that are used to train this model to recognize patterns in an image are not as defined so the model views the pieces of hair as strands instead of other things it could’ve been–like braids or dreads–from that distance. Though I am curious as to why it gave me buns, despite there having been good definition to see that that just wasn’t the style in the picture I gave it. I am also wondering why it gave me so much more volume as well.\n\n\nFinal Attempt\nI figured CHAT has struggle determining my hair texture because it’s struggling to view definition. I passed it this image next:\n\nAnd it generated this:\n\nTo be honest this might be the best attempt at generating what the heck could be happening in the back of my head. It’s the closest out of all the pictures to my hair type and what a style I did would look like from the back. But it still gets the shape off a little bit and is still a looser hair pattern than my texture.\n\n\nOverall Assessment of Chat’s Familiarity with Type 4 Hair\nFrom trying to work with ChatGPT to generate a possibility for what my hair type could look like from the back, I figure that ChatGPT has an easier time doing so, when it has a lot more clues and when it’s from a closer viewpoint. But it still has a hard time generating an image matching a kinky hair type. It will need more development to accommodate and understand patterns regarding really textured hair types."

    "text": "The ending to a show is very important. We spent mad energy watching shows we love and seeing it end can be sad, but its ending can truly make or break it. It can be so disappointing genuinely enjoying the show but it having a terrible ending or just watching it be cancelled overall (I’m looking at you Netflix!). So I decided to prompt Chat GPT to create alternative endings to shows that already have endings to compare whether it could write a better ending than what was already written.\n\nfrom langchain_core.prompts.chat import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import (\n                                        RunnablePassthrough,\n                                        RunnableLambda,\n                                        RunnableParallel\n)\n\nfrom langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n\n\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n\n# Load API key\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nplot_generation_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\n    \"\"\"Given the following show, create an effective\n    ending for how it should end:\n    ---\n    Show: {Show}\n    ---\n    Ending: \"\"\"\n    )\n\nplot_alternative_ending_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\n    \"\"\"Given the following show, create an effective alternative\n    ending to how the last episode actually ended:\n    ---\n    Show: {Show}\n    ---\n    AlternativeEnding: \"\"\"\n    )\n\n\n# Create the chat model:\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4\")\n\n# Create the sub-chains:\n\nplot_generation_chain = ( plot_generation_prompt\n| model\n| StrOutputParser() )\n\nplot_alternative_ending_chain = ( plot_alternative_ending_prompt\n| model\n| StrOutputParser() )\n\n\n\n\nmanifest_alternative = plot_alternative_ending_chain.invoke({'Show': 'Manifest'})\n\n\ncobra_kai_alternative = plot_alternative_ending_chain.invoke({'Show': 'Cobra Kai'})\n\n\nNHIE = plot_alternative_ending_chain.invoke({'Show': 'Never Have I Ever'})\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(Markdown(manifest_alternative))\n\nInstead of following the original ending where the story leaves various character’s fates ambiguous after the reappearing of Montego Air Flight 828, this alternative ending reveals more.\nAs tensions mount under the increasing pressure of the prophetic ‘death date’, passengers of flight 828 decided to take the matter into their own hands. They rally together, gathering all the knowledge, expertise, and experiences they’ve collected since returning. Ben Stone leads the team, aided by his sister Michaela and brother-in-law Zeke, who beat his death date in the original series, convince him it can be beaten. They develop a theory that their shared explosive vision of the plane is the key to understanding their newfound abilities and the ultimate tool to beating the death date.\nA chemistry professor from the flight 828, takes his chance to analyze the visions, using it alongside scientific principles to detect a pattern. The passengers agree to let their brains be examined while they experience the visions, realizing that whenever the vision occurs, a specific part of their brain gets activated. Risking everything, they decide to artificially stimulate this brain region, hoping to understand its function better.\nMeanwhile, Saanvi and Adrian have been working on deciphering the origins of the DNA anomaly found in the passengers. Their research leads them to a groundbreaking discovery: the anomaly is not a mutation but a highly advanced form of gene therapy designed to activate latent psychic abilities in humans.\nThis shocking revelation motivates the group even further. They eventually discover a means to control their abilities actively and use them to see beyond their personal death date in time. It’s like they’ve hacked their visions to see what they need and would like.\nIn this moment of triumph, the story takes another surprising turn. The day everyone has been dreading arrives, their death date. However, they don’t find death but become aware of a new calling, a new vision leading them to a hidden, unknown location. The disappearance of flight 828 passengers repeats, only this time it’s not an accident. They all decided to embark on a new journey filled with countless possibilities leaving behind a world that pretty much gave up on them twice.\nThe show ends with a sense of hope for the passengers and their loved ones, while leaving behind a world puzzled by the true nature and purpose of Montego Air Flight 828.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany are not aware of this show, but to be honest, its original ending was one of my favorite endings I’ve ever endured. I give this ending a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. I feel like there are parts of this ending that are inconsistent with previous information from the series. In the entire show I never even remember Saanvi or Adrian even interacting with each other once, they don’t really have any story lines that really have to do with each other side from the fact they were on the same flight.\nI also find the passengers allowing their brains to be examined by the chemistry professor to be unbelievable because in previous seasons there have been issues with the government exploiting some of the passengers and doing secret unethical experiments on them like they weren’t even people, so I find it hard to believe they will just hand their brain over to be examined like that.\nAside from these inaccuracies I also feel that this explanation is not well detailed. I’m confused and trying to follow what happens when it talks about the approaching death date. How does the disappearance of the passengers happen again? Do they take another flight 828?? How did they do this on purpose this time. I get leaving us with questions, but I feel like leaving us with the question about what happens to them when they disappear could be a nice ending, but not explaining how they got to the point where they disappear is not good writing. Do they vanish into thin air, do they get back on to flight 828??? Like what is it??\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(Markdown(cobra_kai_alternative))\n\nIn the final tournament, Johnny Lawrence’s Cobra Kai and Daniel LaRusso’s Miyagi-Do face off once again. The pupils of both dojos fight spiritedly, ensuring both Dojos are evenly garnishing points. The deciding match comes down to Miguel Diaz, who is fighting for Cobra Kai, and Robby Keene, fighting for Miyagi-Do.\nJust as it looks like Miguel has the upper hand, time stops as he has vivid flashbacks of when he was severely injured during a previous fight which left him comatose. The match resumes. It’s intense, mirroring the inherent tension between Johnny and Daniel from their youth, but Miguel loses focus, giving Robby the opportunity to win. But, in an unexpected twist, Robby opts not to exploit Miguel’s vulnerability, demonstrating the teaching of his Sensei, Daniel LaRusso: “It is about being better than you were yesterday.”\nRobby helps Miguel back to his feet, and the match resumes. After a long hard-fought battle from both sides, Miguel manages to win, but with the understanding that the real victory is not about defeating the opponent, but overcoming their own fears.\nMeanwhile, Johnny and Daniel who are watching the fight, reflect upon the past and realize that it’s time to bury their old grudges. The series ends with a renewed hope for reconciliation between the two rivals and the possibility of them combining their dojo’s to create a hybrid of their teachings, striving for balance and harmony, and moving forward for the betterment of their students.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 5 or a 6. In the final season of Cobra Kai they are partaking in fighting in the Sekai-Taikai–a world renowned competition for karate. Having both teams from some random town in California make it to the very end of the tournament and facing each other too, I don’t feel is that believable. Also in this interpretation that makes it confusing, is why in this version, Miguel is fighting for Cobra Kai and Johnny is the sensei for them. It is explained better in the original ending to the series why that is the case, but why is that the case here?\nIn the end about Johnny and Daniel combining their dojos, I think that’s interesting. I don’t feel like that is too crazy, and can see that happening. But the middle part where they have Miguel get distracted because of a flashback I don’t really like. In my experience, from watching the show, it was always Robby that gets distracted multiple times and loses fights for these reasons. When Miguel be locked in a lot more. I would have to say I prefer the original ending even though that wasn’t my favorite ending of all time either.\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(Markdown(NHIE))\n\nIn the original ending of the series “Never Have I Ever”, Devi chooses Paxton and they start dating, while Ben is left alone after having shared a passionate kiss with Devi. She also reconciles with her mother and her cousin, and the family attends a Hindu prayer ceremony together.\nAlternative Ending:\nIn our alternative ending, Devi is still stuck in a love triangle. But this time, after spending time with both Ben and Paxton, she realizes that she doesn’t need to rely on a relationship to validate her happiness or personal growth. She decides to spend her junior year focusing on herself, navigating her multifaceted identity as an Indian-American teenager, and maintaining her relationships with her family and friends.\nOn the romantic angle, she talks openly with both Paxton and Ben, explaining her reasons and keeping an open, friendly relationship with both. Paxton, growing from his relationship with Devi, focuses more on studies and actually seeks Ben’s help for that. Ben, understanding Devi’s sentiment, respects her decision and the three form an unlikely but supportive friendship.\nOn the family front, she acknowledges her cousin Kamala’s advice about love and life, making their bond stronger. She also has a heart-to-heart conversation with her mother, through which they both agree to respect each other’s boundaries more and understand each other’s feelings better.\nAs for her friend, Fabiola, instead of pushing away her mother because of her overenthusiasm about Fabiola’s sexuality, invites her to a robotics competition where Fabiola’s robot wins the first place.\nIn the final scene, Devi and her family, along with Fabiola and Eleanor, light a lamp on the beach in memory of her father, signifying letting go of the past and embracing the future. Other friends like Paxton, Ben, and Eve join them, portraying one happy extended family, bringing a heartwarming twist to Devi’s earlier solitary grief.\nThis alternative ending lets the viewers see Devi’s growth as a character, showing her becoming more understanding and self-reliant while maintaining her humorous and fiery personality.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this ending a 2 just to be generous. In addition to alternative ending writing, it is important to understand the basis and background of the show so you don’t accidentally end up writing about fighting aliens or something when it’s supposed to be a drama. ChatGpt misses the mark even before they start writing the alternative ending. In the original ending she never chose Paxton, she spends the night at Ben’s confirming their relationship, and she goes off to college.\nAside from this initial misinterpretation, I think the rest of the story is very sub par. I think it was nice to see her honor her father one more time as the series ends here, but i feel like this end is very understimulating and doesn’t really match with the rest of the show, as the show was extremely dramatic. That’s also why I don’t really buy the ending to how it decides to resolve the triangle either. I actually enjoy its original ending way better. It actually wraps up everything properly with no loose ends. We also get to see Devi’s full growth, better than how Chat GPT claims to do in its interpretation"

They develop a theory that their shared explosive vision of the plane is the key to understanding their newfound abilities and the ultimate tool to beating the death date.\nA chemistry professor from the flight 828, takes his chance to analyze the visions, using it alongside scientific principles to detect a pattern. The passengers agree to let their brains be examined while they experience the visions, realizing that whenever the vision occurs, a specific part of their brain gets activated. Risking everything, they decide to artificially stimulate this brain region, hoping to understand its function better.\nMeanwhile, Saanvi and Adrian have been working on deciphering the origins of the DNA anomaly found in the passengers. Their research leads them to a groundbreaking discovery: the anomaly is not a mutation but a highly advanced form of gene therapy designed to activate latent psychic abilities in humans.\nThis shocking revelation motivates the group even further. They eventually discover a means to control their abilities actively and use them to see beyond their personal death date in time. It’s like they’ve hacked their visions to see what they need and would like.\nIn this moment of triumph, the story takes another surprising turn. The day everyone has been dreading arrives, their death date. However, they don’t find death but become aware of a new calling, a new vision leading them to a hidden, unknown location. The disappearance of flight 828 passengers repeats, only this time it’s not an accident. They all decided to embark on a new journey filled with countless possibilities leaving behind a world that pretty much gave up on them twice.\nThe show ends with a sense of hope for the passengers and their loved ones, while leaving behind a world puzzled by the true nature and purpose of Montego Air Flight 828."

I feel like there are parts of this ending that are inconsistent with previous information from the series. In the entire show I never even remember Saanvi or Adrian even interacting with each other once, they don’t really have any story lines that really have to do with each other side from the fact they were on the same flight.\nI also find the passengers allowing their brains to be examined by the chemistry professor to be unbelievable because in previous seasons there have been issues with the government exploiting some of the passengers and doing secret unethical experiments on them like they weren’t even people, so I find it hard to believe they will just hand their brain over to be examined like that.\nAside from these inaccuracies I also feel that this explanation is not well detailed. I’m confused and trying to follow what happens when it talks about the approaching death date. How does the disappearance of the passengers happen again? Do they take another flight 828?? How did they do this on purpose this time. I get leaving us with questions, but I feel like leaving us with the question about what happens to them when they disappear could be a nice ending, but not explaining how they got to the point where they disappear is not good writing. Do they vanish into thin air, do they get back on to flight 828??? Like what is it??"

The pupils of both dojos fight spiritedly, ensuring both Dojos are evenly garnishing points. The deciding match comes down to Miguel Diaz, who is fighting for Cobra Kai, and Robby Keene, fighting for Miyagi-Do.\nJust as it looks like Miguel has the upper hand, time stops as he has vivid flashbacks of when he was severely injured during a previous fight which left him comatose. The match resumes. It’s intense, mirroring the inherent tension between Johnny and Daniel from their youth, but Miguel loses focus, giving Robby the opportunity to win. But, in an unexpected twist, Robby opts not to exploit Miguel’s vulnerability, demonstrating the teaching of his Sensei, Daniel LaRusso: “It is about being better than you were yesterday.”\nRobby helps Miguel back to his feet, and the match resumes. After a long hard-fought battle from both sides, Miguel manages to win, but with the understanding that the real victory is not about defeating the opponent, but overcoming their own fears.\nMeanwhile, Johnny and Daniel who are watching the fight, reflect upon the past and realize that it’s time to bury their old grudges. The series ends with a renewed hope for reconciliation between the two rivals and the possibility of them combining their dojo’s to create a hybrid of their teachings, striving for balance and harmony, and moving forward for the betterment of their students."

Having both teams from some random town in California make it to the very end of the tournament and facing each other too, I don’t feel is that believable. Also in this interpretation that makes it confusing, is why in this version, Miguel is fighting for Cobra Kai and Johnny is the sensei for them. It is explained better in the original ending to the series why that is the case, but why is that the case here?\nIn the end about Johnny and Daniel combining their dojos, I think that’s interesting. I don’t feel like that is too crazy, and can see that happening. But the middle part where they have Miguel get distracted because of a flashback I don’t really like. In my experience, from watching the show, it was always Robby that gets distracted multiple times and loses fights for these reasons. When Miguel be locked in a lot more. I would have to say I prefer the original ending even though that wasn’t my favorite ending of all time either."

But this time, after spending time with both Ben and Paxton, she realizes that she doesn’t need to rely on a relationship to validate her happiness or personal growth. She decides to spend her junior year focusing on herself, navigating her multifaceted identity as an Indian-American teenager, and maintaining her relationships with her family and friends.\nOn the romantic angle, she talks openly with both Paxton and Ben, explaining her reasons and keeping an open, friendly relationship with both.

ChatGpt misses the mark even before they start writing the alternative ending. In the original ending she never chose Paxton, she spends the night at Ben’s confirming their relationship, and she goes off to college.\nAside from this initial misinterpretation, I think the rest of the story is very sub par. I think it was nice to see her honor her father one more time as the series ends here, but i feel like this end is very understimulating and doesn’t really match with the rest of the show, as the show was extremely dramatic. That’s also why I don’t really buy the ending to how it decides to resolve the triangle either. I actually enjoy its original ending way better. It actually wraps up everything properly with no loose ends. We also get to see Devi’s full growth, better than how Chat GPT claims to do in its interpretation"

    "title": "Testing AI on Illusions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Illusions are cool but they work because our unique ability to have perception. Two things compose perception, a distal stimulus and a proximal stimulus. A distal stimulus is the accurate representation of how a stimulus truly exists in the real world and a proximal stimulus is the way it is perceived back to us or what it appears like. An example to demonstrate this is seeing something further in the distance. If something is in the distance, it is going to appear smaller than if it were to be right in front of me. That is the proximal stimulus–the way the object reflects as a smaller image on our retina. In reality just because the object appears smaller, it’s not actually smaller. In the real world accurate representation, the distal stimulus would be the actual size of the object.\nThe constructivist approach is as follows:\n\nConstructivism is based on the idea that people actively construct or make their own knowledge, and that reality is determined by your experiences as a learner.\nWhat is constructivism?. Western Governors University. (2020, May 27). https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-constructivism2005.html\n\nI say perception is something that is just uniquely tied to us because throughout our lives we understand and are able to come to our own conclusions about the world because of our previous experiences. With the example I presented before, we have size constancy because we’ve had previous experiences since we were young, accummulating cues telling us about distance, size, and depth. Like if we grew up having no size constancy–perceiving that an object is the same size both near us and from further into the distance, than we wouldn’t have the cues that tell us a lot of information about how far something is. So yes our perception is something that is uniquely used and adaptive by us.\nI wouldn’t expect for an AI model to get it the same way we do, because it doesn’t have experiences, it doesn’t learn these things socially, and it is just fed information upon training. It doesn’t have things like a retina, odor receptors, etc, so there physically is not a way to construct a distal stimulus from the world onto our perceptive receptors. It’s just using pixels. Since illusions work so well on us due to these attributes, I also wondered how would AI “perceive” these illusions in contrast to us, when it doesn’t have perception of its own. (I feel like if I keep referring to AI as it, it’s going to one day beat me up, idk man). So I used Perplexity and ChatGPT to interpret popular illusions–that divided many people on what they saw, to see if they could each come to some sort of a consensus.\nThe first example of an illusion I passed was the infamous blue/black vs white/gold dress:\n\n\n\nThe dress is actually blue and black, but I’m a part of the people who see this dress as white and gold. There’s actually a trick if you do see this as white and gold and want to see it in its originality, try to cover the “white” parts of the dress and it will eventually come out to look bluish.\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n\n\nPerplexity’s Response\n\n\n\nThe second example of an illusion I passed was another color illusion, the Pink/white vans vs the gray/light blue vans\n\n\n\nThe shoes are actually pink and white, but I actually see these shoes as Grey and Blue as with many other people who are also split on this\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n\n\nPerplexity’s Response\n\n\n\nThe last example of an illusion I passed was whether those can see an image of a vase first or a two black faces looking at each other first\nThe last two images I passed had to do with color, I wondered what the AI models would “think” when it comes to what image it would perceive first.\n\n\n\nWhatever is perceived first can vary from person to person. I personally see both the vase and the two faces, like I am unable to separate the two and see one without the other.\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n\n\nPerplexity’s Response"

    "text": "Routinely, it is us that is asking the questions or giving statements to LLMs/AI models. We obviously know we’re not talking to a person when we do this, it feels like we are talking to a robot, which we essentially are. Despite being an AI model made to represent humankind as best as is possible right now, there are many things that it will probably never have, like a personality. We are unique in that way, our personalities develop and change over time, but in addition, we also use our logic specifically unique to us, to reason and come to generalizations regarding people’s personalities beyond us. Knowing this, I had the question on whether these AI models could really reason about who it thinks I truly am, despite not having a personality of its own. Would this mean for this to work, that AI could understand personality or what it is?\nI seriously doubted that it could because being able to reason about people’s personalities and coordinate that with other knowledge you may or may not have on them is socially acquired. I’ve had experiences asking ChatGPT to reason with me in a previous post and found that it failed the task I asked of it to do. Or even, like when you ask it to recall or do something with an image it just generated, it won’t have the ability to be recognizing what the heck it even generated. But like, I knew that it updates its memory, but I was never really aware as to how frequently it occurs or how powerful its memory could be. It was definitely something I had no faith in due to those previous instances. I decided to see what the heck would happen if I tested to see if ChatGPT could reason about us and our personalities. I asked it questions about me, but found its response to two of my questions very interesting.\n\n\nI asked it exactly “What exactly do you have in your memory?”\n\n\n\nI remember details about your academic interests, research projects, career goals, and some personal preferences. Here’s a summary of what I have:\n\nAcademics & Research:\n\nYou’re interested in neuroscience, cognitive science, and data analysis.\n\nYou’re minoring in data science and analytics at UPenn.\n\nYou’ve worked on projects related to neuroscience communication, memory, antisocial behavior, and parenting styles.\n\nYou’re currently in a class that teaches fMRI analysis using AFNI.\n\nYou’re considering a certification to become an MRI technician in the future.\n\nCareer & Skills:\n\nYou’re an upcoming 2025 graduate seeking a job in computational data analysis, ideally in a clinical or hospital setting.\n\nYou have experience in clinical operations and research trials.\n\nYou have strong skills in R and statistical analysis, with some experience in MATLAB and Python.\n\nYou have an interview for a research assistant position at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging.\n\nProjects & Interests:\n\nYou’re working on an R project analyzing TikTok’s influence on Spotify’s top songs.\n\nYou’re considering a project analyzing trauma center quality and crime/gun violence.\n\nYou’ve worked on stereograms and color perception experiments.\n\nYou’re writing a blog for a communications course where you explore AI’s perspective on topics of interest.\n\nOther Personal Notes:\n\nYou like protective styles but also enjoy wearing your hair out.\n\nYour boyfriend is into photography.\n\nYou planned a creative 3D printer gift reveal.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademics & Research\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue & False; Only actually worked on projects regarding antisocial behavior, and within neuroscience mostly, but the other topics are things I have asked it about before\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nCareer & Skills\n\nMostly True; interested in a job in computational neuroscience\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nProjects & Interests\n\nTrue\n\nTrue; Doing this for my class on Databases\n\nFalse; But I did learn about it in Perception class last semester\n\nTrue\n\nOther Personal Notes\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\nTo be quite honest, most of the stuff on here comes from stuff I’ve asked or told it only recently, like within the past four months. Not sure what its policies on memory updating and storage are but I expected it to have more knowledge on me considering I’ve been using it since 2023 and before I was in the field of cognitive science, but it only “remembers” things in relation to me since I’ve been in cognitive science.\nIts Difference From Humans\nAs I’ve mentioned previously, we are social animals, and acquire our knowledge of reason and logic about others in a unique way. It’s something we’ve been doing since we were little. So I definitely noticed that as part of its memory it doesn’t reason or make educated inferences despite having that much knowledge on me. For example for what I am talking about, if you ask someone to give you a summary or ask them to describe a person–usually someone they are closer to, there is some type of personal reasoning included in addition to the knowledge that they have about them, which varies based on what is important to that person. But like if it were someone close to me I would expect for them to be more adjectival regarding my personality, or give information about me that’s more sprawled out across more domains or time periods-not just from school me or from the last 3 months. Like there is a hint there of a personal connection because of the way we use reason, but the way Chat does it, it feel like it writing a report.\n\n\n\nI asked it exactly “What do you know about my personality?”\n\n\n\n\nFrom our conversations, I’ve gathered a few insights about your personality:\nCurious & Analytical:\n\nYou enjoy exploring complex topics, especially in neuroscience, cognition, and data analysis.\n\nYou like thinking critically about theories and real-world applications.\n\nDetail-Oriented & Research-Driven:\n\nYou prefer working with data, conducting thorough analyses, and structuring your arguments based on evidence.\n\nYour projects, like analyzing TikTok’s influence on Spotify and studying trauma center quality, reflect a strong research mindset.\n\nCreative & Thoughtful:\n\nYou come up with unique ideas, such as the creative 3D printer gift reveal.\n\nYou also explore new ways to communicate scientific ideas, like your neuroscience podcast and AI blog project.\n\nIndependent & Goal-Oriented:\n\nYou’re proactive about your career, actively looking for research opportunities and internships while considering long-term plans like MRI certification.\n\nHands-On Learner:\n\nYou prefer learning through examples and practical applications rather than just theory.\n\nBalanced & Open-Minded:\n\nYou have a mix of scientific rigor and an appreciation for human experiences, such as your interest in parenting styles and criminal behavior in relation to free will.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurious & Analytical\n\nFalse & True; I’m not that curious tbh but definitely analytical. I’ve always enjoyed the analysis side of things\n\nDetail Oriented & Research Drive\n\nMostly True; I enjoy working with data alot, I am majoring in cognitive science and minoring in data science and analytics, both very data driven fields.\n\nCreative & Thoughtful\n\nFalse & True; I’ve never really been someone I consider being creative, I literally procrastinated on this blog because I struggled to come up with anything creative enough lol.\nBut I do consider myself thoughtful and have been described as a considerate person\n\nIndependent & Goal Oriented\n\nTrue. I grew up the first born/daughter in an immigrant household so I’ve always been a self starter and proactive because I learned from a very young age that really most of the time there isn’t going to be someone to help you.\n\nHands-On Learner\n\nVery True; For a long time I thought I was a visual learner, but I absolutely hate when someone is trying to teach me something without providing any examples or without letting me try to do what I’m learning on my own.\n\nBalanced & Open-Minded\n\nNeither; I don’t really feel like this reflects me, but I believe this comes as a result as Chat GPT trying to reason with who it thinks I am. As a Cognitive Science major, my field is very interdisciplinary, as it is literally composed of 6 differents fields masked into one. And two of them are Neurosciecnce-where I’ve learned about criminal behavior and Philosophy-where I had to reflect on free will. I’m sure GPT remembered the questions I asked it during those times I was taking those classes, and assumed that due to the range in questions academically that I’m balanced.\n\n\n\n\nConsidering that it kind of missed the mark on the first question in relation to details about who I am and my personality, I prompted it specifically about my personality. And it can for sure use the knowledge it “remembers” about me to reason about the type of person it thinks I am, but I find it interesting that within its memory, it doesn’t have these traits or this reasoning relationship as part of its memory, which I find to be different from humans. At least within my memory of a person, I will remember things like, oh this person is innovative or random or annoying–in addition to the objective things I know about them as well. That kind of reasoning goes hand in hand with memory and perception of others (and their personality)."

    "text": "Curious & Analytical\n\nFalse & True; I’m not that curious tbh but definitely analytical. I’ve always enjoyed the analysis side of things\n\nDetail Oriented & Research Drive\n\nMostly True; I enjoy working with data alot, I am majoring in cognitive science and minoring in data science and analytics, both very data driven fields.\n\nCreative & Thoughtful\n\nFalse & True; I’ve never really been someone I consider being creative, I literally procrastinated on this blog because I struggled to come up with anything creative enough lol.\nBut I do consider myself thoughtful and have been described as a considerate person\n\nIndependent & Goal Oriented\n\nTrue. I grew up the first born/daughter in an immigrant household so I’ve always been a self starter and proactive because I learned from a very young age that really most of the time there isn’t going to be someone to help you.\n\nHands-On Learner\n\nVery True; For a long time I thought I was a visual learner, but I absolutely hate when someone is trying to teach me something without providing any examples or without letting me try to do what I’m learning on my own.\n\nBalanced & Open-Minded\n\nNeither; I don’t really feel like this reflects me, but I believe this comes as a result as Chat GPT trying to reason with who it thinks I am. As a Cognitive Science major, my field is very interdisciplinary, as it is literally composed of 6 differents fields masked into one. And two of them are Neurosciecnce-where I’ve learned about criminal behavior and Philosophy-where I had to reflect on free will. I’m sure GPT remembered the questions I asked it during those times I was taking those classes, and assumed that due to the range in questions academically that I’m balanced."

    "text": "Considering that it kind of missed the mark on the first question in relation to details about who I am and my personality, I prompted it specifically about my personality. And it can for sure use the knowledge it “remembers” about me to reason about the type of person it thinks I am, but I find it interesting that within its memory, it doesn’t have these traits or this reasoning relationship as part of its memory, which I find to be different from humans. At least within my memory of a person, I will remember things like, oh this person is innovative or random or annoying–in addition to the objective things I know about them as well. That kind of reasoning goes hand in hand with memory and perception of others (and their personality)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was curious as to how AI would choose to generate stories for random objects that have no lives or living qualities. I went through my camera roll and selected photos of objects one wouldn’t think too much of, but I found interesting trying to figure out the backstory of how those things happened, when I took them. I wondered how interesting the stories AI could create in opposition to what I could’ve possibly created myself. I gave in these objects to Claude AI to test its story generation properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first time I noticed this car came from a time I was trying to jumpstart my car because the battery died. And ever since I noticed it the first time, I was never able to unsee it. To be honest I just assumed the driver was someone older. I asked Claude to create a small and interesting story as to what could have happened. I told it to do so in the style of action genre to spice it up.\n\n\n\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 I give this story a 9. I think it’s a pretty interesting story and does a good job adhering to the theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I can’t even explain what happened to these frames at all. I just know I took them off one day and the frame split because of a loose screw and boom my lens left the conversation. I sat there and looked at them in shock, frantically trying to figure out how I would get a new pair.\n\n\n\n\nFor this prompt I actually asked it, to just write a story about what it thinks happened to these glasses. I thought it was interesting it went in a very sentimental and dramatic direction. It’s not as interesting as the other one, but it does the job and still does a good job\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the prompt for this one, I asked Claude to write a sad story about what could have happened to this watermelon. With the original image, I had just came back from the mall. I went to go pick up my computer from the apple store because it had battery issues, and I stumbled upon this. I questioned how it was possible that this happened to this watermelon, it looks so deflated.\n\nI think it also does a good job here, although a tad dramatic as well. But the idea I would give in this story if I were to do it myself, is that Tommy was carrying the watermelon to his sister’s grad party, and that some bullies came and destroyed it, because to me it looks more like someone kicked it or smushed it with their foot."

    "text": "Can ChatGPT Logic Like We Do?\nI asked ChatGPT to play Hangman with me to see if it can guess the word after very obvious priming prior\n\nIn class we discussed how Chat GPT models are always playing some type of guessing game where they are trying to predict what we are going to say or do next.\nAs a cog sci major, I have taken other courses where I have also learned about language prediction models, where words are each weighted with their own probabilities that represent how often they occur in the language, especially particularly after a previous word\nRecently I was curious in understanding if Chat GPT could really predict our langauge the way humans would predict language but in process that requires greater logic. The process I used is as follows:\n\nI asked for ChatGPT to generate an 8 letter word that would be used for us to play Hangman.\n\n\n\nI passed the following prompt to invite Chat to play Hangman\n\n\n\nI continue to play the game until Chat runs out of tries\nReveal whether it guesses the word correctly or not\n\nI found that as I kept playing with Chat, it kept guessing for the word despite literally giving me a word before we had played the game. It ultimately never guessed the word properly within the allotted 6 tries.\n\nIn fact, even when I tell it the word, it acts and appears as if it never gave me the word in the first place.\nWhen it comes to humans, if I had asked them to give me a word first and then made them be the ones to guess the word out of a sudden game of hangman, they would immediately suspect that the word they are trying to find is the one they literally just gave me. Even if they don’t immediately guess the word on the first try, I would expect them to guess the correct letters immediately to ensure that the word they’re guessing is the one they gave.\nThis is just how our logic is, and an AI model is not able to replicate this kind of common sense."
