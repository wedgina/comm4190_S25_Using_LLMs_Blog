    "Routinely, it is us that is asking the questions or giving statements to LLMs/AI models. We obviously know we're not talking to a person when we do this, it feels like we are talking to a robot, which we essentially are. Despite being an AI model made to represent humankind as best as is possible right now, there are many things that it will probably never have, like a personality. We are unique in that way, our personalities develop and change over time, but in addition, we also use our  logic specifically unique to us, to reason and come to generalizations regarding people's personalities beyond us. Knowing this, I had the question on whether these AI models could really reason about who it thinks I truly am, despite not having a personality of its own. Would this mean for this to work, that AI could understand personality or what it is? "

    "I seriously doubted that it could because being able to reason about people's personalities and coordinate that with other knowledge you may or may not have on them is socially acquired. I've had experiences asking ChatGPT to reason with me in a previous post and found that it failed the task I asked of it to do. Or even, like when you ask it to recall or do something with an image it just generated, it won't have the ability to be recognizing what the heck it even generated. But like, I knew that it updates its memory, but I was never really aware as to how frequently it occurs or how powerful its memory could be. It was definitely something I had no faith in due to those previous instances. I decided to see what the heck would happen if I tested to see if ChatGPT could reason about us and our personalities. I asked it questions about me, but found its response to two of my questions very interesting."

    "To be quite honest, most of the stuff on here comes from stuff I've asked or told it only recently, like within the past four months. Not sure what its policies on memory updating and storage are but I expected it to have more knowledge on me considering I've been using it since 2023 and before I was in the field of cognitive science, but it only \"remembers\" things in relation to me since I've been in cognitive science.\n",

    "As I've mentioned previously, we are social animals, and acquire our knowledge of reason and logic about others in a unique way. It's something we've been doing since we were little. So I definitely noticed that as part of its memory it doesn't reason or make educated inferences despite having that much knowledge on me. For example for what I am talking about, if you ask someone to give you a summary or ask them to describe a person--usually someone they are closer to, there is some type of personal reasoning included in addition to the knowledge that they have about them, which varies based on what is important to that person. But like if it were someone close to me I would expect for them to be more adjectival regarding my personality, or give information about me that's more sprawled out across more domains or time periods-not just from school me or from the last 3 months. Like there is a hint there of a personal connection because of the way we use reason, but the way Chat does it, it feel like it writing a report. "

And it can for sure use the knowledge it \"remembers\" about me to reason about the type of person it thinks I am, but I find it interesting that within its memory, it doesn't have these traits or this reasoning relationship as part of its memory, which I find to be different from humans. At least within my memory of a person, I will remember things like, oh this person is innovative or random or annoying--in addition to the objective things I know about them as well.

    "Anywho, I feel like I further understand that ChatGPT is not really there to be your friend lol but then again it makes sense considering all I've ever heard it be described or marketed as, is to be your personal assistant. All in all, it's just there to do its job. While I did find it kind of somewhat impressive on what it \"thinks\" about me (as it is usually interesting to ask anybody anything about what they know about you), our personalities and our reasoning regarding other people is unique to us, and is not able to be replicated by ChatGPT. It was just interesting to think about how it would try to do these tasks I asked of it considering it doesn't even have its own personality."
