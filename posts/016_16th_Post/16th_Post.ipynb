    "As part of my neuro and society class last semester, we had a guest lecturer for it who studied behavioral neuroscience I think as part of the Wharton school or something like that. He came to the class with findings from some fMRI study that studied people who were loyal to either Apple or Samsung and I think they showed them ads that related to each brand, and it showed that there was increased activity in the amygdala region for people who were loyal to Apple. If I remember correctly this appeared to be the case for a lot of people who were strictly loyal to one brand in other scenarios. It made me wonder whether I could somewhat replicate this with AI. This will be some part of a challenge as it is difficult to ask AI for their opinion because they're meant to be objective. "

    "I took our class as inspiration to ask the LLM as a way to subtly and subjectively ask it to rank the options. In our class for the most part, we actually had the same rankings for the options available but there were some variability, and the answers Chat produced count as that variability because they do not reflect the same rankings we had in class. For the refresher, our rankings were mostly 1. the internet, 2. the printing press, 3. generative ai and 4. smartphone and Chat, gave a response different to this. I'm actually surprised that it ranked the printing press that low as I feel that when it came out it was very revolutionary for its time and is still praised as such in modern day. "

    "I feel like originally I would have ranked Samsung before Google, but then I thought about this outside the context of just phones and I feel like I can now personally agree with this list actually. I even mention in the beginning how researchers really only found activation in the brains of people who are loyal to Apple but they didn't really find the same effects in people who use Samsung because their consumers don't have a crazy loyalty to its brand. It doesn't capture the same loyalty in its users like Apple does, so the part where it mentions it being seen as more of a competitor and not a game changer, made a lot of sense to me. However I do ask it for its opinion on these tech brands in the last decade, and in my experience, I don't feel that Google really made gigantic advancements or impacts until maybe the last half of the decade. Like I think the Google Phone Pixel thing is actually cool but I don't really feel like there are many people who talk that much about their products like that as when Samsung was a gigantic competitor against Apple."

    "Maybe this is the gen z in me talking but personally I would put Facebook last. I feel like a lot of people be against tiktok and/or are against it. It's literally always being threatened to be banned like everyday because of how powerful it is, people have concerns. I do agree that it hasn't even been around for that long and that's why I wouldn't rank it any higher than 3rd place. I feel like for each of these things aside from Facebook they completely changed the way we consume media in some way, like Google Search Engine was like the very first of its kind to make actually searching the web easy, and is one of the most important platforms that exists in our lives everday to this day. I agree with its reasoning on Youtube and the long way it's came and how it has completely revolutionized how we consume video media as well. And I believe that tiktok has follows right after that, since it's really novel in the way we consume multiple forms of media at once, it's a youtube/twitter/reddit/ instagram, (sometimes even Google) and more all at once essentially. I don't really feel like Facebook is that revolutionary on its own in getting us to connect with people like that when there were already cool things that did the same back then too like MySpace. "
